    "abstract": "AIM: Self-reported cognitive function has been described as an important complement to performance-based measurements but has seldom been investigated in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors. Therefore, the aim was to describe self-reported cognitive function and its association with health status, psychological distress, and life satisfaction.\nMETHODS: This study utilised data from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (2018-2021), registered 3-6 months post-CA. Cognitive function was assessed by a single question: \"How do you experience your memory, concentration, and/or planning abilities today compared to before the cardiac arrest?\". Health status was measured using the EQ VAS, psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and overall life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction checklist. Data were analysed using binary logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Among 4026 identified survivors, 1254 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.9 years (SD = 13.4) and 31.7% were female. Self-reported cognitive function among survivors was reported as: 'Much worse' by 3.1%, 'Worse' by 23.8%, 'Unchanged' by 68.3%, 'Better' by 3.3%, and 'Much better' by 1.5%. Declined cognitive function was associated with lower health status (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 2.09-3.64), symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.84, 95% CI = 2.80-5.24) and depression (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.22-6.32), and being dissatisfied with overall life (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.11-3.54). These associations remained significant after age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, initial rhythm, initial witnessed status, and cerebral performance were controlled.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survivors experiencing declined cognitive function post-CA are at a higher risk of poorer health status, increased psychological distress, and reduced life satisfaction, and these risks should be acknowledged by healthcare professionals.",

    "abstract": "Background Assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive screening are widely used in the care of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Evidence linking them to post-discharge outcomes is limited, but could support targeted rehabilitation efforts. Aim To assess whether ADL ability measures and cognitive screening at hospital discharge were associated with post-discharge ADL ability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and return to work. Methods This prospective cohort study included 200 OHCA survivors admitted to Aarhus University Hospital. Self-reported ADL ability was measured using the Activities of Daily Living Interview (ADL-I). Observed ADL ability was measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), dichotomised into age-matched or below-ability. Cognitive function was assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariable regressions, with multiple imputation, analysed associations between variables and outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Adjusted analyses showed significant associations between personal ADL-I (βadjusted = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2;0.5) and AMPS (βadjusted = -0.6, 95%CI:-1.2;-0.03) at discharge and self-reported ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest. Baseline AMPS was statistically significantly associated with age-matched ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest (ORadjusted 5.5, 95%CI: 1.5;10.0), and personal ADL-I (VAS: βadjusted = 3.00, 95%CI: 1.3;4.6/index score: βadjusted = 0.03, 95%CI 0.01;0.05) and MoCA (index: βadjusted = -0.09, 95%CI: -0.2;-0.02) with HRQoL. The association between MoCA and return to work one-year after cardiac arrest showed an OR of 3.0 (95%CI: 0.5;9.0), although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions Decreased ADL ability at hospital discharge was associated with poorer post-discharge outcomes in OHCA survivors, while cognitive screening was also associated with certain aspects of recovery.",

OHCA survivors from participating sites were contacted 5-8 years post OHCA. Survival rates were collected from medical registries. Telephone interviews were performed to collect basic outcomes and quality of life. Questionnaires surveyed patients and relatives levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep, fatigue, cognitive decline and everyday life participation.\nRESULTS: 279 patients were included at the participating sites, 161 (58%) were still alive. A vast majority of the participating survivors (97.8%) had favourable outcomes (CPC 1-2) and quality of life was comparable to the background population. Among the participating OHCA survivors, 5.5% met the criteria for anxiety, 2.7% for depression, 4.5% for PTSD, 24.5% reported sleep problems, 45.5% reported fatigue, and 40.7% were working full- or part-time. Among the participating relatives, 7.0% met the criteria for anxiety, 1.2% for depression, 3.5% for PTSD, and 52.3% of the relatives reported that the patient had suffered cognitive decline post OHCA. ROSC delay, higher age, and female sex were negatively associated with several long-term outcomes. Treatment allocation was not associated with better outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term OHCA survivors had acceptable outcomes, though self-reported sleep and fatigue problems and relatives-reported cognitive decline were prevalent. Higher age and longer ROSC delay were risk factors of poorer outcome, primarily driven by mortality. Female sex was a risk factor of worse self-reported outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01689077.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an emergency with historically low survival rates. Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers.\nOBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being.\nMETHODS: The Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants aged ≥18 years and caregivers aged ≥21 years will be recruited from all public hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, and Zarit Burden Interview.\nDISCUSSION: This study allows us to understand the natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA sequelae.",

Patients with clinical issues will be referred for psychological support or to a community rehabilitation program. Feasibility will be defined as a recruitment rate ≥ 80% and acceptability as a retention rate ≥ 50% over 12 months.: Based on historical data from the Lombardia CARe, an estimated 350 eligible survivors are expected, which will allow estimation of a prevalence ranging between 20% and 30% with 5% precision and 95% confidence.: This study will be the first in Italy to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional system for pre-/post-discharge evaluation of cognitive impairment, mental health, and quality of life in a large cohort of OHCA survivors, documenting the prevalence of these disorders.",

We quantified emotional distress using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge.\nRESULTS: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard deviation ± 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted β's [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems should consider implementing routine in-hospital screening for emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence for CA survivors who are awake, alert and approaching hospital discharge, and prioritize brief in hospital treatment or post-discharge referrals.",

At three months, four subtests of the performance-based Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) (Trail making, Color-word interference, Verbal fluency, and Figure design), the patient-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A), and the observer-reported 16-item Short Form (SF) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline after Cardiac Arrest (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) were collected. Spearman's rank coefficient correlation analysis was performed to examine correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A, and SF-16 IQCODE-CA.\nRESULTS: Overall, 21% of survivors exhibited impairment in executive functioning using the D-KEFS subtest Color-word interference, while only 9% self-reported executive impairment (BRIEF-A) and 7% of relatives reported cognitive decline (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) in survivors at three months post-arrest. All correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A and SF-16 IQCODE-CA were negligible to low.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this REVIVAL substudy suggest that although the performance-based and reported measures did not correlate, dual neurocognitive screening tools containing both a self-reported and an informant-reported version may have the potential to detect executive discrepancies in the return to everyday life and guide targeted neurorehabilitation after OHCA.",

This study describes long-term observer-reported cognitive decline among Danish OHCA survivors, including differences in years since the event, and investigates characteristics and self-reported outcomes associated with observer-reported cognitive decline.\nMETHODS: Adults who survived an OHCA from 2016 to 2019, and their relatives, completed the national DANish Cardiac Arrest Survivorship survey. Relatives completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the World Health Organisation-Five Well-being index; and survivors completed the Two Simple Questions (everyday activities and mental recovery), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, HADS, and the Short World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Potential associations between survivor characteristics and the IQCODE-CA were investigated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Self-reported outcomes among survivors and relatives, and the association with IQCODE-CA scores were investigated using separate logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Total median IQCODE-CA score was 3.04 (IQR: 3.00-3.27), with 47% having possible cognitive decline (score ≥ 3.04), consistent across time groups. Increasing age (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) and worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes for survivors and relatives, except 'everyday activities' were significantly associated with possible cognitive decline among survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of OHCA survivors may suffer long-term cognitive decline. Worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes among survivors and their relatives are associated with potential cognitive decline emphasising the need for post-OHCA care to include systematic neurocognitive assessment, tailored support and effective rehabilitation.",

However, experiences of caring for an OHCA survivor are sparsely described. Thus, this study aimed to explore how family caregivers of OHCA survivors experience the potential burden.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using an explorative qualitative approach, six focus group interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 family caregivers of OHCA survivors and analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach inspired by the philosophy of Ricoeur. The OHCA survivors attended a rehabilitation course, and the family caregivers were interviewed as part of the course.Based on the analysis, three themes emerged: (i) feeling unexpectedly alone and invisible; the family caregivers experienced an emotional burden that could not be shared-leading to caregiving being a lonely experience, (ii) fear of loss; the fear of losing a loved one was a constant companion contributing to the burden, and (iii) adjusting to a new everyday life; the family caregivers had difficulties adjusting to living their lives on the premise of the survivors' needs.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study emphasize the burden experienced by family caregivers and how they can be trapped in competing emotions and tensions. The possible caregiver burden following OHCA should be acknowledged. Interventions to reduce the burden should be tested and implemented as part of the clinical care of OHCA survivors and their families.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most cardiac arrest (CA) survivors report good health and quality of life. Life satisfaction on the other hand has not yet been studied in a large scale in the CA population. We aimed to explore life satisfaction as perceived by CA survivors with three research questions addressed: (1) how do CA survivors report their life satisfaction, (2) how are different domains of life satisfaction associated with overall life satisfaction, and (3) how are demographic and medical factors associated with overall life satisfaction?\nMETHODS: This registry study had a cross-sectional design. Life satisfaction was assessed using the 11-item Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11). The sample included 1435 survivors ≥18 years of age. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were used.\nRESULTS: Survivors were most satisfied with partner relation (85.6%), family life (82.2%), and self-care (77.8%), while 60.5% were satisfied with overall life. Satisfaction with psychological health was strongest associated with overall life satisfaction. Among medical and demographic factors, female sex and poor cerebral performance were associated with less overall life satisfaction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Generally, CA survivors seem to perceive similar levels of overall life satisfaction as general populations, while survivors tend to be significantly less satisfied with their sexual life. Satisfaction with psychological health is of special interest to identify and treat. Additionally, female survivors and survivors with poor neurological outcome are at risk for poorer overall life satisfaction and need special attention by healthcare professionals.",

We measured quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Levels questionnaire. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders were common among patients with good neurologic recovery. There were 23 patients who experienced cognitive impairments (23.7%) and 28 who suffered from mood disorders (28.9%). Age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12), mood disorders (adjusted OR 22.80, 95% CI 4.84-107.49) and hospital length of stay (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive impairments (adjusted OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.83-35.97) and non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 11.51, 95% CI 3.15-42.15) were risk factors for mood disorders. Quality of life was significantly lower in the OHCA survivors with each disorder than the healthy individuals. Routine screening and intervention are needed for OHCA survivors.",

At discharge, 60% were on paid sick leave, and 20% at 12 months. Age (per one year older) increased the odds of experiencing the composite endpoint at 3 and 12 months (3 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.10, 12 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.09) among the total population (n = 184). Self-reported health at discharge was not associated with the endpoint.\nCONCLUSION: One-fifth of the OHCA survivors at a working-age prior to the OHCA was still on paid sick leave after 12 months. Increasing age was the only characteristic associated with a composite endpoint of prolonged sick leave or leaving the workforce at 3 and 12 months after discharge. With increasing survival rates, healthcare professionals need to support the population in resuming daily life, including returning to the workforce, when relevant.",

Thirty-three out-of-hospital SCA survivors (8 women and 25 men) participated. Time since cardiac arrest was on average 12-57 months. An exploratory qualitative design inspired by Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutics was applied. Two main themes emerged from the analysis and interpretation: (i) a lack of support from the health system in the transition from hospital to daily life; and (ii) feeling understood for the first time. The findings revealed that out-of-hospital SCA survivors experience a knowledge gap struggling for support. Attending the programme, gaining knowledge and experiencing peer support was described as a revelation for them.\nCONCLUSION: The findings suggest that out-of-hospital SCA survivors felt understood for the first time when attending a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. A post-arrest pathway is needed led by a coordinating cardiac arrest specialist nursing service together with allied healthcare professionals. Focus on hypoxic brain injuries, emotional burdens, and supportive strategies are essential in the transition to daily life. Facilitated peer support is warranted.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, approximately 292,000 adults (>18 years old) per year suffer an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Survival rates have increased over the last decade and many survivors return to their communities. IHCA has been recognized as a unique disease entity because the arrest happens in a medical care setting and survivors often have more medical co-morbidities. Although more individuals are surviving IHCA, very little is known about their long-term recovery experiences. Semi-structured interviews with 19 IHCA survivors were conducted to better understand their recovery experiences and identify strategies of adaptation that they felt aided their recovery. Thematic analysis indicated that IHCA survivors experience ongoing challenges to recovery. Reconceptualization of independence was necessary for some participants to re-engage in social and physical activities and a few were able to engage in new activities. Our findings suggest that IHCA survivors often develop their own strategies for adaptation in order to continue participation in their social lives and that their recovery experiences are ongoing. Intervention programs and follow-up care should continuously ask survivors what is important to them and identify resources that will support their goals. Questions should include physical, cognitive, psychological and social goals that extend beyond those specifically related to IHCA since our findings indicate that the effects of IHCA are long-lasting and encompass all aspects of survivors' lives.",

The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nMETHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nRESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5).\nDISCUSSION: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL.",

    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate associations between provider-patient communication, readiness for discharge, and patients' illness perceptions with post-arrest quality of life (QoL).\nMETHODS: We distributed an online survey to survivors of cardiac arrest who were members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. Survivors completed the Questionnaire for the Quality of Provider-Patient Interactions (QQPPI), Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). When completing the QQPPI and RHDS, survivors were asked to think back to their hospitalization and discharge. QoL domains (physical, psychological, social) were measured via the WHO-QOL BREF. Three multiple regression models examined associations between QQPPI, RHDS, and B-IPQ scores with QoL domains, adjusted for age, sex, months since arrest, self-reported understanding of cardiac arrest and potential post-arrest symptoms at discharge, self-reported memory at discharge, and functional status as defined by the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.\nRESULTS: A total of 163 survivors (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean time since arrest: 63.9 months) provided complete survey data. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.45, p ​< ​0.001) and lower readiness for discharge (β: 0.21, p ​= ​0.01) were associated with worse physical QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.47, p ​< ​0.001) was associated with worse psychological QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.28, p ​= ​0.001) and poor provider-patient communication (β: 0.35, p ​< ​0.001) were associated with worse social QoL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modifiable provider-patient relationship factors and illness perceptions were associated with quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest with good neurologic recovery.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over 400,000 adults suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) each year in North America. Despite a very high mortality rate, even 10% survival means that a minimum of 3500 people return to their lives and their families. However, their experience of living and their health-related quality of life after such a life-changing event are quite variable, much more complex than just having lived or died, and should not be reduced to crude measures of neurological functioning.\nMETHODS: We conducted 32 in-depth qualitative interviews with survivor/family member dyads at various stages of survival. The interviews focused on the recovery journey, long-term issues most important to them and how measuring such concepts could help. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative thematic analysis techniques.\nRESULTS: During in-depth interviews with more than 30 survivors and caregivers we have heard that despite being a relatively high functioning group, their lives have been deeply affected by their cardiac arrest experience. They speak about the importance of both psychologic and physical recovery, the impact of return to work or changes in work identity and the necessity of support from family members in the recovery process. Spouses/family members also mentioned differences in perspective on their loved one's recovery and how they manage the fear of recurrence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work purposively brings a unique lens to the concept of cardiac arrest outcomes by placing priority on what is important to survivors and their families and what we may be missing in standard outcomes measures. There is a clear need for a more patient-centred outcome set for this population and our work indicates that psychologic assessment, return to work status and family input are key domains to be considered.",
