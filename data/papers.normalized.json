    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there is a growing body of research in the field of post-cardiac arrest outcomes and survivorship, the lived experience of close family members who witness the arrest itself and who may have performed CPR, has not been specifically explored.\nMETHODS: We employed qualitative interpretive descriptive methodology using key informant interviews for data collection. Participants were recruited internationally, and interviews were conducted virtually following a semi-structured format. Thematic data analysis was conducted using a constant comparative approach.\nRESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 33 family members who were present at the time of their loved ones cardiac arrest. Across the participant stories, we identified the core concept of 'base trauma' that centres around what family member witnesses initially experience at the time of the arrest itself. We postulate that this core theme influences six significant patterns of experience including: 1) feelings of responsibility, 2) fear of recurrence without them, 3) the impact of reliving the event, 4) the inability to escape triggers, 5) the delayed realization of their own trauma, and lastly 6) dealing with psychologic disconnect.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is increasing research evidence that family members of cardiac arrest survivors have their own challenges as part of the recovery journey. We introduce novel concept of the compounded impact of the initial base trauma those that witness and respond to a loved ones cardiac arrest have. The nuanced experiences of this group point to the need to normalize their experience as a 'trauma' and suggest that support pathways need to recognize this.",

Interventions to prevent chronic distress post-CA are needed. We developed(RT-CA), an intervention to increase resiliency in CA survivor-caregiver dyads (pairs).\nMETHOD: We will conduct an open pilot clinical trial of RT-CA to examine preliminary feasibility and refine the intervention based on participant feedback. We will enroll at least 7 CA survivor-caregiver dyads during their hospitalization at a single academic medical center. We will identify eligible survivors by screening admission reports and through referrals from medical staff.: Survivors - sufficient cognitive status to meaningfully participate (Short Form of the Mini Mental State Exam ≥5). Dyads - English-speakers; one member must have clinically significant distress (≥8 on either Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale).dyads will participate in 6, 30-45 min sessions with a study clinician. Sessions will include mind-body coping skills training and provision of anticipatory guidance and resources to navigate CA-survivorship. Dyads will complete pre- and post-test measures of emotional distress and treatment targets. We will calculate frequencies and proportions of our primary outcomes (feasibility - recruitment, assessments, adherence, therapist fidelity and acceptability/credibility). After completing post-test assessments, dyads will provide feedback via exit interviews. We will integrate qualitative and quantitative data using explanatory-sequential mixed-methods.\nDISCUSSION: We will use our findings to refine RT-CA content and study procedures. If successful, RT-CA has potential to significantly improve quality of survivorship for CA survivors and their caregivers.",

This study aimed to explore through participatory and creative methods, children and young people's (CYP) experiences post-cardiac arrest intensive care. Participatory research includes drawing, painting and small-world play. CYPs were recruited who had been admitted to intensive care post-cardiac arrest and had the cognitive and physical ability to talk, draw, paint or play out their experiences. Seven CYPs and families consented to participate. The median number of interviews was two (IQR2,3), with a median interview length of 24 minutes (IQR15,65 minutes). Themes that emerged: gratitude, distrust and extrasensory experiences. Four of the seven (57%) participants opted to paint or draw to convey their experiences. Two (28%) participants had no memories of their cardiac arrest or time in intensive care but used creative methods to express gratitude to the care team. Participatory research methods may be an effective way for CYPs to convey their experiences of post-cardiac arrest intensive care. CYPs who have been critically ill have expressed a need to make sense of their experiences in intensive care. Healthcare professionals should be aware that these experiences may be deemed as extrasensory and require sensitive exploration.",

Therefore, the aim was to describe self-reported cognitive function and its association with health status, psychological distress, and life satisfaction.\nMETHODS: This study utilised data from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (2018-2021), registered 3-6 months post-CA. Cognitive function was assessed by a single question: \"How do you experience your memory, concentration, and/or planning abilities today compared to before the cardiac arrest?\". Health status was measured using the EQ VAS, psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and overall life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction checklist. Data were analysed using binary logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Among 4026 identified survivors, 1254 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.9 years (SD = 13.4) and 31.7% were female. Self-reported cognitive function among survivors was reported as: 'Much worse' by 3.1%, 'Worse' by 23.8%, 'Unchanged' by 68.3%, 'Better' by 3.3%, and 'Much better' by 1.5%. Declined cognitive function was associated with lower health status (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 2.09-3.64), symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.84, 95% CI = 2.80-5.24) and depression (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.22-6.32), and being dissatisfied with overall life (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.11-3.54). These associations remained significant after age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, initial rhythm, initial witnessed status, and cerebral performance were controlled.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survivors experiencing declined cognitive function post-CA are at a higher risk of poorer health status, increased psychological distress, and reduced life satisfaction, and these risks should be acknowledged by healthcare professionals.",

Although resuscitation advancements have increased survival, many survivors suffer cognitive impairments that affect their quality of life. Most research has focused on neurological outcomes, whereas little attention has been paid to cognitive function. The aim is to investigate the proportion of cognitive impairment in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest and to investigate the association between the duration of cardiac arrest and level of cognitive function.\nMETHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 184 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening tool. Duration of cardiac arrest was defined by no flow, low flow, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. Multiple logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) and CI.\nRESULTS: Of 184 survivors assessed, 26% had normal cognitive function at discharge, increasing to 67% at 6 months (n=149). Median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score improved from 23 (Q25-Q75: 20-26) to 26 (Q25-Q75: 24-28). At 6 months, adjusted ORs per minute were 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for low flow and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for time to return of spontaneous circulation, whereas associations at discharge were near null (aOR≈0.99). No significant association was found either at discharge or follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function improved considerably within 6 months following cardiac arrest, with the proportion of patients exhibiting normal cognitive function increasing from 26% to 67%. This study found no association between the duration of cardiac arrest and cognitive function.",

Evidence linking them to post-discharge outcomes is limited, but could support targeted rehabilitation efforts. Aim To assess whether ADL ability measures and cognitive screening at hospital discharge were associated with post-discharge ADL ability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and return to work. Methods This prospective cohort study included 200 OHCA survivors admitted to Aarhus University Hospital. Self-reported ADL ability was measured using the Activities of Daily Living Interview (ADL-I). Observed ADL ability was measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), dichotomised into age-matched or below-ability. Cognitive function was assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariable regressions, with multiple imputation, analysed associations between variables and outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Adjusted analyses showed significant associations between personal ADL-I (βadjusted = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2;0.5) and AMPS (βadjusted = -0.6, 95%CI:-1.2;-0.03) at discharge and self-reported ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest. Baseline AMPS was statistically significantly associated with age-matched ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest (ORadjusted 5.5, 95%CI: 1.5;10.0), and personal ADL-I (VAS: βadjusted = 3.00, 95%CI: 1.3;4.6/index score: βadjusted = 0.03, 95%CI 0.01;0.05) and MoCA (index: βadjusted = -0.09, 95%CI: -0.2;-0.02) with HRQoL. The association between MoCA and return to work one-year after cardiac arrest showed an OR of 3.0 (95%CI: 0.5;9.0), although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions Decreased ADL ability at hospital discharge was associated with poorer post-discharge outcomes in OHCA survivors, while cognitive screening was also associated with certain aspects of recovery.",

Applying the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), cognition and symptoms of psychopathology were assessed in survivors during hospitalisation. At three-month follow-up, we evaluated clinical symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using IES-R, and clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression with HADS in relatives. Logistic regression models were applied.\nRESULTS: At follow-up, 146 relatives (84% females) from 297 OHCA survivors participated. Median age was 55 years (IQR 21-79 years). Overall, relatives were found with clinical symptoms of PTSD (25%), anxiety (27%), and depression (14%). In unadjusted analysis, early cognitive impairment (MoCA score < 26) in survivors was associated with higher odds of clinical symptoms of PTSD in relatives (OR (95% CI) 2.61 (1.09-6.24, = 0.03) at three-months follow-up. This association was no longer significant after adjusting for age.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms of PTSD and anxiety were common in relatives of survivors at three months post-cardiac arrest. Further research is needed to identify factors that may be associated with mental health challenges in relatives to support these families early in the cardiac arrest survivorship.",

Early prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical measures predict long-term outcomes.\nMETHODS: In a longitudinal multicenter cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26).\nRESULTS: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive relation with twelve-month MoCA (β = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94). Early HADS was associated with twelve-month HADS (β = 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.60, p < 0.001), with age negatively associated (β = -0.10, 95 % CI: -0.18 to -0.02, p = 0.019). No other significant relations were found.\nCONCLUSION: MoCA and HADS scores during hospitalization relate to long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes after cardiac arrest. These measures may help identify patients who could benefit from cognitive rehabilitation or psychosocial support.",

OHCA survivors from participating sites were contacted 5-8 years post OHCA. Survival rates were collected from medical registries. Telephone interviews were performed to collect basic outcomes and quality of life. Questionnaires surveyed patients and relatives levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep, fatigue, cognitive decline and everyday life participation.\nRESULTS: 279 patients were included at the participating sites, 161 (58%) were still alive. A vast majority of the participating survivors (97.8%) had favourable outcomes (CPC 1-2) and quality of life was comparable to the background population. Among the participating OHCA survivors, 5.5% met the criteria for anxiety, 2.7% for depression, 4.5% for PTSD, 24.5% reported sleep problems, 45.5% reported fatigue, and 40.7% were working full- or part-time. Among the participating relatives, 7.0% met the criteria for anxiety, 1.2% for depression, 3.5% for PTSD, and 52.3% of the relatives reported that the patient had suffered cognitive decline post OHCA. ROSC delay, higher age, and female sex were negatively associated with several long-term outcomes. Treatment allocation was not associated with better outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term OHCA survivors had acceptable outcomes, though self-reported sleep and fatigue problems and relatives-reported cognitive decline were prevalent. Higher age and longer ROSC delay were risk factors of poorer outcome, primarily driven by mortality. Female sex was a risk factor of worse self-reported outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01689077.",

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro were searched to 14 February 2025. Eligible studies included adults (≥18 years) who received conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation for IHCA and reported neurological, cognitive, psychological, or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes at ≥ 3 months post-IHCA. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Meta-analyses of binary outcomes were performed using random-intercept logistic regression. Narrative synthesis was used where pooling of results was not feasible. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251009496).\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine studies from 21 countries were included (sample size n = 16-1539 patients). Most were moderate to high risk of bias. Across the full cohort, the pooled proportion of poor neurological outcome was 78.9% (95% CI 73.5-83.4%; I = 95.6%). Among survivors, 9.9% (95% CI 5.8-16.3%; I86.4%) had poor neurological outcome, with lower proportions at longer follow-up. Clinically significant anxiety and depression affected 13.1% (95% CI 6.1-26.0%; I = 92.3%) and 8.1% (95% CI 4.6-13.7%; I = 75.7%) of survivors, respectively. HRQoL impairments were frequently reported, particularly in pain/discomfort (60.5% [95% CI 57.9-63.0%; I = 37.6%]), usual activities (52.6% [95% CI 50.0-55.2%; I = 0.0%]), and anxiety/depression (49.0% [95% CI 46.4-51.6%; I = 0.0%]). Cognitive impairments were reported in one study. Substantial statistical heterogeneity (I > 75%) was observed across most analyses. Wide variation in outcome measures, follow-up duration, and reporting methods limited synthesis.\nCONCLUSION: While many IHCA survivors achieve favourable long-term outcomes, a significant proportion experience persistent impairments. Greater standardisation in outcome measurement and reporting is needed to improve comparability across studies and guide post-arrest care.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors often face significant health challenges, including insomnia, which can adversely affect their health-related quality of life. The Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) is a brief, self-reported instrument designed to screen for insomnia. This study aimed to identify the measurement properties of the MISS in CA survivors and to explore a relevant cut-off score.\nMETHODS: Data were collected from two studies: a health survey of CA survivors and a sub-study of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on targeted temperature management (TTM2). A total of 269 CA survivors participated, with 212 from the survey and 57 from the RCT, the data was collected 6-7 months after CA. The MISS was evaluated using the polytomous Rasch model, focusing on model fit, local independence, response category functioning, targeting, reliability, and differential item functioning (DIF).\nRESULTS: In total, 212 participants were males and 57 females, with a mean age of 66 years. Overall, 51% had survived in-hospital CA and 49% out-of-hospital CA. The MISS exhibited acceptable model fit and targeting, with no disordered thresholds or DIF for age, sex, or place of arrest. The reliability was acceptable. The suggested optimal cut-off score for identifying insomnia was ≥6 points.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that MISS is a valid and reliable screening instrument for insomnia in CA survivors. These results support the use of MISS for screening insomnia in CA survivors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an emergency with historically low survival rates. Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers.\nOBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being.\nMETHODS: The Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants aged ≥18 years and caregivers aged ≥21 years will be recruited from all public hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, and Zarit Burden Interview.\nDISCUSSION: This study allows us to understand the natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA sequelae.",

The aims were to determine 1) the prevalence of PTG, and 2) the influence of survivor characteristics during hospitalization on levels of PTG at follow-up in a Danish cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors.\nMETHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study including OHCA survivors, exploring soci-odemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics using the Montreal Cognitive Assess-ment (MoCA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Crisis Support Scale (CSS) during hospitalization. At three-month follow-up, structured interviews were conducted to assess PTG at personal, relational, and institutional levels. The influence of survivor characteristics on PTG was explored using Pearson's chi-square tests.\nRESULTS: Overall, 173 survivors were included. At follow-up, 87% of survivors reported hav-ing one or more levels of PTG. The analysis revealed that the absence of cognitive impairment (MoCA ≥ 26 vs. MoCA < 26) was associated with personal growth ( = 0.02), being younger (<58 years vs. ≥ 58 years) with relational growth ( = 0.03) and being female or having symp-toms of depression (HADS ≥ 8 vs. HADS < 8), with institutional growth ( = 0.02 and = 0.04), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The OHCA survivors reported high levels of PTG at three-month follow-up. The type of PTG level was influenced by the absence of cognitive impairment, younger age, fe-male sex, and symptoms of depression during hospitalisation. Social support, symptoms of anxiety, and traumatic distress did not significantly influence the level of PTG.",

Survivors were grouped by time since cardiac arrest: 0-4, >4-8, >8-12, and >12 years post-arrest. Among 2552 respondents (56.1% response rate), 2075 were men (81.3%) and 477 were women (18.7%). The mean survey age was 60.2 years (SD 14.7) for women and 66.0 years (SD 11.8) for men. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and EuroQol Health Questionnaire index scores were both lower for women than for men [69 vs. 75 and 0.76 (SD 0.21) vs. 0.84 (SD 0.17), respectively; P < 0.001]. The SF-12 physical and mental health scores were also lower for women [40.3 (SD 12.9) and 50.9 (SD 8.8)] compared with men [44.0 (SD 12.1) and 53.3 (SD 8.1); P < 0.001]. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for anxiety (5.4 vs. 3.5; P < 0.001) and for depression (4.0 vs. 3.2; P < 0.001) were higher among women. In multivariable logistic regression, female sex remained significantly associated with poorer long-term HRQoL outcomes. Trends remained consistent regardless of time since cardiac arrest.\nCONCLUSION: Female OHCA survivors reported less favourable long-term HRQoL outcomes compared with male survivors, irrespective of time elapsed since cardiac arrest.",

To address this, we adapted a resilience intervention for survivors and their caregivers, entitled Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest (RT-CA).\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of RT-CA between 09/2024-03/2025. We enrolled dyads of consecutively admitted CA survivors at Massachusetts General Hospital and their primary family caregivers.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: adult English speakers, survivors must have ability to meaningfully participate (Short Form Mini Mental State Exam ≥5), one dyad member must have emotional distress (≥8 on either subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]).\nPROCEDURE: Dyads participated in six weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist focused on building mindfulness and coping skills. Feasibility outcomes were feasibility of recruitment, assessments, adherence; acceptability outcomes were satisfaction, credibility, expectancy. Dyads completed pre- and post-test psychosocial measures and participated in exit interviews. We calculated frequencies and proportions of our outcomes, conducted exploratory paired t-tests to examine initial signals of changes in psychosocial measures, and performed explanatory-sequential mixed methods to integrate data sources.\nRESULTS: We screened 12 dyads and enrolled 7. RT-CA exceeded most feasibility and acceptability benchmarks (>70 % on 7 of 8). In exploratory analyses, participants experienced preliminary, yet meaningful reductions in emotional distress (HADS anxiety survivors: mean [95 % CI] = -5.4 [-3.4, -7.5], p < 0.001; depression survivors = -5.1 [-2.2, -8], p < 0.01; anxiety caregivers = -3.1 [-0.8, -5.5], p < 0.05; depression caregivers = -3.5 [-8, 1.1], p > 0.05). Mixed-methods analysis indicated general concordance between quantitative and qualitative data.\nCONCLUSION: Results support preliminary feasibility of RT-CA. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial is now required.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT06517394.",

However, no definitive data are available on this topic, so this study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional screening system for OHCA survivors in Italy and the prevalence of these disorders.: OHCA survivors discharged with good neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ≤ 2 and modified Ranking Scale (mRS) ≤ 3) from hospitals in the \"Lombardia CARe\" registry will be evaluated by a clinical psychologist using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) at pre-discharge or within 15 days and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients with clinical issues will be referred for psychological support or to a community rehabilitation program. Feasibility will be defined as a recruitment rate ≥ 80% and acceptability as a retention rate ≥ 50% over 12 months.: Based on historical data from the Lombardia CARe, an estimated 350 eligible survivors are expected, which will allow estimation of a prevalence ranging between 20% and 30% with 5% precision and 95% confidence.: This study will be the first in Italy to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional system for pre-/post-discharge evaluation of cognitive impairment, mental health, and quality of life in a large cohort of OHCA survivors, documenting the prevalence of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of volunteer responders attending a paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (POHCAs) in Denmark.\nDESIGN: This qualitative study used the Reflective Lifeworld Research theoretical framework. Data were generated through nine in-depth, in-person or virtual semistructured interviews conducted with volunteer responders.\nSETTING: The study was conducted in Denmark. We recruited volunteer responders from all of Denmark enrolled in the nationwide volunteer responder programme.\nPARTICIPANTS: Nine volunteer responders who were dispatched in response to a POHCA from 2020 to 2023 were included in the study.\nRESULTS: The experiences of attending a POHCA were categorised into three key themes: the mission, the situation and the aftermath. The mission refers to the altruistic drive of volunteer responders to contribute to life-saving efforts. The situation reflects the profound shock experienced when volunteer responders realise that the patient is a child, alongside their ability to act decisively and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the situation. The aftermath reveals the deep sense of fulfilment derived from being present and actively involved in attempting to save a child's life, as well as the various emotions and reactions that the volunteer responders process after the event.\nCONCLUSION: Attending a POHCA is a profoundly intense experience that can leave an emotional impact on the volunteer responders. On arriving at the location, despite the initial shock upon realising that the patient is a child, the volunteer responders engage in the resuscitation attempt and offer support to the child's family. However, alerting the volunteer responders beforehand that the patient is a child may help mitigate the initial shock. Volunteer responders find significant meaning in their roles and express a strong commitment to saving lives, irrespective of the age of those in need.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent medical care and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given that in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still poorly investigated, data on health-associated quality of life thereafter remains scarce. The available evidence is mostly transferred from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies, but the epidemiology and determinants of success might be different. The aim of the study was to investigate the change in the quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify potential risk factors for a poor outcome.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis of data and prospective evaluation of quality of life included all patients surviving an IHCA and being treated by the emergency medical team between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint of the study was the quality of life after IHCA at the reference date. Secondary endpoints covered determination of risk factors and predictors of poor outcome after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nRESULTS: In total 604 patients were resuscitated within the period of 11 years and 61 (10%) patients survived until the interview took place. Finally, 48 (79%) patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 31 (65%) were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest (EQ-5D-5L utility 0.79 vs. 0.78, p = 0.567) and in the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) score.\nCONCLUSION: The quality of life before and after IHCA in survivors was good and comparable. The quality of life was mostly affected by reduced mobility and anxiety/depression. Future studies with larger patient samples should focus on potentially modifiable factors that could prevent, warn, and limit the consequences of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Moreover, research on outcomes of IHCA should include available tools for the quality of life assessment.",

Nevertheless, the relationship between PICS-relevant domains in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and psychological distress in their family members (henceforth, PICS-F) remains underexplored.: We enrolled consecutive CA patients admitted between 16 August 2021 and 28 June 2023 to an academic medical center, along with their close family members, in prospective studies. Survivors' PICS domains were: physical dependence (Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, PSMS), cognitive impairments (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-M), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS) symptoms (PTSD Checklist-PCL 5), as well as PICS-F (PCL-5 Total Score). Hierarchical multivariate linear regressions examined associations between PICS-F and survivors' PICS domains.: Of 74 dyads (= 148), survivors had a mean () age of 56 ± 16 years, with 61% being male and with a median hospital stay of 28 days. Family members (43% spouses) were slightly younger (52 ± 14 years), predominantly female (72%), and of minority race/ethnicity (62%). A high prevalence of PICS assessed 28.5 days (interquartile range 10-63) post-CA was observed in survivors (78% physical dependence, 54% cognitive impairment, 30% PTSS) and in family members (30% PTSS). Survivor PTSS was significantly associated with family member distress (= 0.3,= 0.02), independent of physical dependence (= 0.0,= 0.9), cognitive impairment (= -0.1,= 0.5), family member characteristics, and duration of hospitalization.: Both CA survivors and their family members showed substantial evidence of likely PICS. Survivor PTSS is notably associated with family member distress, highlighting the need for dyadic interventions to enhance psychosocial outcomes.",

Thus, the objectives were to i) describe differences in self-reported mental well-being, mental health, and caregiver strain at different time points (1-5 years) post-OHCA and ii) investigate characteristics associated with caregiver strain.\nMETHODS: A national cross-sectional survey (DANCAS) from October 2020 to March 2021 with OHCA survivors and their closest relatives. The relative survey included the WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (M-CSI). Differences in scores between time groups were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between characteristics and caregiver strain were investigated with multivariable logistic regression models, presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for gender, age, education status, relative affiliation, and time after OHCA.\nRESULTS: Of 561 relatives, 24% (n = 137) experienced caregiver strain, with no significant differences in the relatives' mental well-being, mental health, or caregiver strain with time since OHCA. In the adjusted analyses, older age (OR 0.98 95% CI 0.96;0.99) and several self-reported outcomes, including reduced mental well-being (WHO-5 OR 7.27 95% CI 4.86;11.52), symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A OR 6.01 95% CI 3.89;9.29) and depression (HADS-D OR 15.03 95% CI 7.33;30.80) were significantly associated with worse caregiver strain.\nCONCLUSION: Nearly one-quarter of relatives of OHCA survivors experience caregiver strain, with this proportion remaining unchanged with time. Several outcomes were associated with caregiver strain, emphasising the need to identify relatives at greater risk of burden following OHCA.",

These instruments were administered at 6-months in the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM2) trial. We used a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery from a TTM2 trial sub-study as a gold standard to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the neurocognitive screening.\nRESULTS: In our cohort of 108 OHCA survivors (median age = 62, 88% male), the most favourable cut-off scores were: MoCA < 26; SDMT z ≤ -1; IQCODE-CA ≥ 3.04. The MoCA (sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.85) and SDMT (sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.83) had a higher classification accuracy than the TSQ (sensitivity 0.28, specificity 0.74) and IQCODE-CA (sensitivity 0.42, specificity 0.60). When using the cut-points for MoCA or SDMT in combination to identify neurocognitive impairment, sensitivity improved (0.81, specificity 0.74), area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI [0.69, 0.85]. The most common unidentified impairments were within the episodic memory and executive functions domains, with fewer false negative cases on the MoCA or SDMT combined.\nCONCLUSION: The MoCA and SDMT have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for screening for neurocognitive impairment in an OHCA population, and when used in combination the sensitivity improves. Patient and observer-reports correspond poorly with neurocognitive performance.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov Identifier: NCT03543371.",

We quantified emotional distress using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge.\nRESULTS: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard deviation ± 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted β's [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems should consider implementing routine in-hospital screening for emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence for CA survivors who are awake, alert and approaching hospital discharge, and prioritize brief in hospital treatment or post-discharge referrals.",

At three months, four subtests of the performance-based Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) (Trail making, Color-word interference, Verbal fluency, and Figure design), the patient-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A), and the observer-reported 16-item Short Form (SF) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline after Cardiac Arrest (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) were collected. Spearman's rank coefficient correlation analysis was performed to examine correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A, and SF-16 IQCODE-CA.\nRESULTS: Overall, 21% of survivors exhibited impairment in executive functioning using the D-KEFS subtest Color-word interference, while only 9% self-reported executive impairment (BRIEF-A) and 7% of relatives reported cognitive decline (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) in survivors at three months post-arrest. All correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A and SF-16 IQCODE-CA were negligible to low.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this REVIVAL substudy suggest that although the performance-based and reported measures did not correlate, dual neurocognitive screening tools containing both a self-reported and an informant-reported version may have the potential to detect executive discrepancies in the return to everyday life and guide targeted neurorehabilitation after OHCA.",

Functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) holds potential to contribute to prediction of cognitive outcomes. In this study, we investigated the possible value of early changes in resting-state networks for predicting short and long-term cognitive functioning of cardiac arrest survivors. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in cardiac arrest survivors in three Dutch hospitals. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired within a month after cardiac arrest. We primarily focused on functional connectivity within the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), and additionally explored functional connectivity in seven other networks. Cognitive outcome was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during hospital admission and at 3 and 12 months, and by neuropsychological examination (NPE) at 12 months. We tested mixed effects models to evaluate the value of connectivity within the networks for predicting global cognitive outcomes at the three time points, and long-term cognitive outcomes in the memory, attention, and executive functioning domains. We included 80 patients (age 60 ± 11 years, 72 (90%) male). MoCA scores increased significantly between hospital admission and 3 months (ΔMoCA = 2.89, p < 0.01), but not between 3 and 12 months (ΔMoCA = 0.38, p = 0.52). Connectivity within the DMN, SN, and dorsal attention network (DAN) was positively related to global cognitive functioning during hospital admission (β = 0.85, p = 0.03; β = 1.48, p < 0.01; β = 0.96, p = 0.01), but not at 3 and 12 months. Network connectivity was also unrelated to long-term memory, attention, or executive functioning. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN, SN, and DAN measured in the first month after cardiac arrest is related to short-term global, but not long-term global or domain-specific cognitive performance of survivors. These results do not support the value of functional connectivity within these RSNs for prediction of long-term cognitive performance after cardiac arrest.",

Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D-5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate.\nRESULTS: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 ± 0.24 vs 0.82 ± 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 ± 21 vs 79 ± 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension.\nCONCLUSIONS: Norwegian OHCA survivors reported poorer health than the general population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L. PROMs use in this population can be used to inform follow-up and health care delivery.",

There is limited knowledge regarding the likelihood of further recovery in the cognitive, emotional, and quality of life domains. We aimed to estimate the probability of recovery towards independency.\nMETHODS: From a prospective Registry on comatose cardiac arrest patients admitted between 2013 and 2017 in two Dutch hospitals, we included patients with a CPC3 at six months after cardiac arrest. We followed patients up to November 2023. The primary outcome measure was the CPC score at time of follow up. Secondary outcomes were scores on questionnaires on cognition, mood, and quality of life according to the minimal dataset of acquired brain injury.\nRESULTS: In our cohort of 667 patients, 29 (4.3%) had a CPC3 score at six months (median age 68 years, 83% male). At a median time of eight years after cardiac arrest, sixteen patients had died. Twelve of thirteen alive patients still had a CPC3 score (92%) and one a CPC2 (8%). Seven patients agreed with further interviewing, one showed independency in activities of daily living (14%). Six patients (86%) reported limitations due to physical and one (14%) due to emotional problems. All had severe cognitive impairment. Six (86%) missed cognitive rehabilitation.\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows that while the probability of recovery towards independence for patients with severe neurological disability at six months after cardiac arrest is limited, most long-term survivors are satisfied with their quality of life.",

Learning about the long-term outcomes is very important for developing prognostication guidelines, improving post-cardiac care, counseling caregivers about the future of their child, and creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention studies to improve outcomes. Few PICUs worldwide provide a multidisciplinary follow-up program as routine practice at an outpatient clinic with standardized measurements, using validated instruments including neuropsychological assessments by psychologists. The primary goal of such a follow-up program should be to provide excellent care to children and their caregivers, thereby resulting in a high attendance. Pediatric psychologists, neurologists and pediatricians/pediatric intensivists should ideally be involved to screen for delayed development and psychosocial problems and offer appropriate care at the same time. Preferably, outcomes should consist of evaluation of morbidity (physical and neuropsychological), functional health and Health Related Quality Of Life (QoL) of the patient and their caregivers.",

Cardiac arrest survivors and family members (of survivors and non-survivors) were engaged as \"experience experts,\" collaborators and co-researchers in this study.\nMETHODS: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of cardiac arrest survivors and family members was conducted. Participants were recruited from the membership of the Family Centred Cardiac Arrest Care Project. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using Framework analysis.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight participants described 22 unique cardiac arrest events. We identified five primary care need themes: 1) \"Help us help our loved one\"; 2) \"Work with us as a cohesive team\"; 3) \"See us: treat us with humanity and dignity\"; 4) \"Address our family's ongoing emergency\"; and 5) \"Help us to heal after the cardiac arrest\" as well as 29 subordinate care need themes. We performed touchpoint mapping to identify key moments of interaction between patients and families, and the health system to highlight potential areas for improvement, as well as strategies for meeting family care needs.\nCONCLUSION: Our participants identified varied family care needs during and long after cardiac arrest. Fortunately, many proposed strategies are inexpensive and have low barriers to adoption. However, some unmet care needs identified suggest larger systemic issues such as service gaps that leave families feeling abandoned and isolated. Overall, our findings suggest that care during and after cardiac arrest are critical components of a comprehensive cardiac arrest care system.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Brain injury is the leading cause of death following cardiac arrest and is associated with severe neurologic disabilities among survivors, with profound implications for patients and their families, as well as broader societal impacts. How these disabilities affect long-term survival is largely unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether complete neurologic recovery at hospital discharge after cardiac arrest is associated with better long-term survival compared with moderate or severe neurologic disabilities.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from 4 mandatory national registers with structured and predefined data collection and nationwide coverage during a 10-year period in Sweden. Participants included adults who survived in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) beyond 30 days and who underwent predefined neurologic assessment conducted by health care professionals at hospital discharge using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale between January 2010 and December 2019. Patients were divided into 3 categories: complete recovery (CPC 1), moderate disabilities (CPC 2), and severe disabilities (CPC 3-4). Statistical analyses were performed in December 2023.\nEXPOSURE: CPC score at hospital discharge.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was long-term survival among patients with CPC 1 compared with those with CPC 2 or CPC 3 or 4.\nRESULTS: A total of 9390 cardiac arrest survivors (median [IQR] age, 69 .0 [58.0-77.0] years; 6544 [69.7%] male) were included. The distribution of functional neurologic outcomes at discharge was 7374 patients (78.5%) with CPC 1, 1358 patients (14.5%) with CPC 2, and 658 patients (7.0%) with CPC 3 or 4. Survival proportions at 5 years were 73.8% (95% CI, 72.5%-75.0%) for patients with CPC 1, compared with 64.7% (95% CI, 62.4%-67.0%) for patients with CPC 2 and 54.2% (95% CI, 50.6%-57.8%) for patients with CPC 3 or 4. Compared with patients with CPC 1, there was significantly higher hazard of death for patients with CPC 2 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.40-1.75]) or CPC 3 or 4 (aHR, 2.46 [95% CI, 2.13-2.85]). Similar associations were seen in the OHCA and IHCA groups.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with cardiac arrest who survived beyond 30 days, complete neurologic recovery, defined as CPC 1 at discharge, was associated with better long-term survival compared with neurologic disabilities at the same time point.",

This study describes long-term observer-reported cognitive decline among Danish OHCA survivors, including differences in years since the event, and investigates characteristics and self-reported outcomes associated with observer-reported cognitive decline.\nMETHODS: Adults who survived an OHCA from 2016 to 2019, and their relatives, completed the national DANish Cardiac Arrest Survivorship survey. Relatives completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the World Health Organisation-Five Well-being index; and survivors completed the Two Simple Questions (everyday activities and mental recovery), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, HADS, and the Short World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Potential associations between survivor characteristics and the IQCODE-CA were investigated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Self-reported outcomes among survivors and relatives, and the association with IQCODE-CA scores were investigated using separate logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Total median IQCODE-CA score was 3.04 (IQR: 3.00-3.27), with 47% having possible cognitive decline (score ≥ 3.04), consistent across time groups. Increasing age (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) and worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes for survivors and relatives, except 'everyday activities' were significantly associated with possible cognitive decline among survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of OHCA survivors may suffer long-term cognitive decline. Worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes among survivors and their relatives are associated with potential cognitive decline emphasising the need for post-OHCA care to include systematic neurocognitive assessment, tailored support and effective rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Patients discharged from intensive care are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which consists of physical, psychological, and/or neurological impairments. This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93). More than one-third of cardiac arrest survivors experience symptoms of PICS 2 years after resuscitation, with the highest impairment observed in the physical and psychological domains. However, long-term survivors of cardiac arrest report intact health-related quality of life when compared to the general population. Future research should focus on appropriate prevention, screening, and treatment strategies for PICS in cardiac arrest patients.",

Whether cognitive impairment at hospital discharge is associated with recovery defined as functional status and fatigue measured at 1-month post-discharge is not known.\nMETHODS: Consecutive CA patients admitted at an academic center (May 14, 2021-June 23, 2023) were assessed for cognitive impairment (modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-m < 33) and depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire) at hospital discharge. Poor functional status (primary outcome; modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3) and fatigue severity (patient-reported outcome; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were assessed 1-month post-discharge. Hierarchical regressions tested associations of cognitive function with outcomes.\nRESULTS: Of 112 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 14.8; 38% female; 43% White race, 20% Black race, 29% Hispanic ethnicity) completing discharge TICS-m, 63 (56%) had indicated cognitive impairment, and 68 (61%) had poor 1-month functional outcome. Worse discharge cognitive function was independently associated with a higher risk of poor 1-month functional outcome (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02) after adjusting for age, education, sex, race, ethnicity, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and depressive symptoms. Fatigue severity lacked significant associations with cognitive function, but was associated with depressive symptoms (B = 1.03 [0.00, 2.05], p = 0.04).\nCONCLUSION: Cognitive function at discharge after CA was significantly and independently associated with functional outcome 1 month after hospital discharge. Psychological distress contributed to fatigue severity. This highlights the need for screening and addressing cognitive and emotional problems pre-hospital discharge.",

Guidelines recommend early screening to identify patients at risk for cognitive impairment, but there is no consensus on the best screening method. We aimed to identify quantitative EEG measures relating with short- and long-term cognitive function after cardiac arrest for potential to cognitive outcome prediction.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study designed to develop a prediction model for cognitive outcome after cardiac arrest. For the current analysis, we used twenty-minute EEG registrations from 80 patients around one week after cardiac arrest. We calculated power spectral density, normalized alpha-to-theta ratio (nATR), peak frequency, and center of gravity (CoG) of this peak frequency. We related these with global cognitive functioning (scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) at one week, three and twelve months follow-up with multivariate mixed effect models, and with performance on standard neuropsychological examination at twelve months using Pearson correlation coefficients.\nRESULTS: Each individual EEG parameter related to MoCA at one week (β = 7.36; P < 0.01; βfrequency = 1.73, P < 0.01; β = -9.88, P < 0.01). The nATR also related with the MoCA at three months ((β = 2.49; P 0.01). No EEG metrics significantly related to the MoCA score at twelve months. nATR and peak frequency related with memory performance at twelve months. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSION: Early resting-state EEG parameters relate with short-term global cognitive functioning and with memory function at one year after cardiac arrest. Additional predictive values in multimodal prediction models need further study.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: About 60 to 70% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors who worked before cardiac arrest return to work within one year but the precise conditions for this resumption of professional activity remain little known. The objective of this study was to assess components of return to work among OHCA survivors.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the French national multicentric cohort AfterRosc to include OHCA survivors admitted between April 1st 2021 and March 31st 2022, discharged alive from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who were less than 65 years old. A phone-call interview was performed one year after OHCA to assess return to work, level of education, former level of occupation as well as neurological recovery. Geographic and socio-economic data from the patient's residential neighborhoods were also collected. Comparisons were performed between patients who returned to work and those who did not, using non-parametric tests.\nRESULTS: Of the 251 patients included in the registry, 86 were alive at ICU discharge and 31 patients that worked prior to the OHCA were included for analysis. Seventeen survivors returned to work after a median delay of 112 days [92-157] Among them, nine (53%) had required initial work adjustments. Overall, only 6 patients (19%) had returned to work ad integrum. Higher educational level, work which required higher competence-level, higher income, living in a better socio-economical neighborhood, as well as better scores on all three standardized MPAI-4 score components (abilities, adjustment and participation) were significantly associated with return to work. Participants that had not returned to work had a significant drop of income (p = 0.0025).\nCONCLUSION: In this prospective study regarding French OHCA survivors, return to work is associated with better socio-economical individual and environmental status, as well as better scores on all MPAI-4 components.",

Four major databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO; January 1995-January 2022, updated July 2023) for qualitative studies exploring survivors' and/or key supporters' experiences of cardiac arrest survival. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) were applied to evaluate the overall confidence in research findings. Constructs were identified from each paper, informing theme and sub-theme development.\nRESULTS: From 15,917 unique titles/abstracts and 196 full-text articles, 32 met the inclusion criteria. Three themes captured the survivors' experiences: 1) Making sense of my cardiac arrest; 2) Learning to trust my body and mind; and 3) Re-evaluating my life. A further three themes reflected key supporters' experiences: 1) Emotional turmoil; 2) Becoming a carer: same person but different me; and 3) Engaging with a new and unknown world. However, limited data and some methodological weaknesses in included studies reduced confidence in several themes. The findings were conceived within the overarching concept of 'negotiating a new normal'.\nCONCLUSIONS: The enduring psychosocial and physical sequelae of cardiac arrest survival substantially impacts the lives of survivors and their key supporters, requiring negotiation of their 'new normality'. The need for sense-making, physical and psychological recovery, and the new roles for key supporters should be strong considerations in the development of future interventions.",

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among this population was higher than that in the general population.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of depression or anxiety and the association of these conditions with long-term mortality among individuals who survive OHCA.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal population-based cohort study was conducted to analyze long-term prognosis in patients hospitalized for OHCA between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2015, who survived for 1 year or longer. Patients with cardiac arrest due to traumatic or nonmedical causes, such as injuries, poisoning, asphyxiation, burns, or anaphylaxis, were excluded. Data were extracted on depression or anxiety diagnoses in this population within 1 year from the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service and analyzed April 7, 2022, and reanalyzed January 19 to 20, 2023.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Follow-up data were obtained for up to 14 years, and the primary outcome was long-term cumulative mortality. Long-term mortality among patients with and without a diagnosis of depression or anxiety were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The analysis included 2373 patients; 1860 (78.4%) were male, and the median age was 53.0 (IQR, 44.0-62.0) years . A total of 397 (16.7%) patients were diagnosed with depression or anxiety, 251 (10.6%) were diagnosed with depression, and 227 (9.6%) were diagnosed with anxiety. The incidence of long-term mortality was significantly higher in the group diagnosed with depression or anxiety than in the group without depression or anxiety (141 of 397 [35.5%] vs 534 of 1976 [27.0%]; P = .001). With multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of long-term mortality for total patients with depression or anxiety was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.17-1.70); depression, 1.44 (95% CI, 1.16-1.79); and anxiety, 1.20 (95% CI, 0.94-1.53).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, among the patients who experienced OHCA, those diagnosed with depression or anxiety had higher long-term mortality rates than those without depression or anxiety. These findings suggest that psychological and neurologic rehabilitation intervention for survivors of OHCA may be needed to improve long-term survival.",

HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure.\nRESULTS: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1-q3) = 70 (50-80). Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 4-8% of the total variance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Since IHCA survivors with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous stroke.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive activity and awareness during cardiac arrest (CA) are reported but ill understood. This first of a kind study examined consciousness and its underlying electrocortical biomarkers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nMETHODS: In a prospective 25-site in-hospital study, we incorporated a) independent audiovisual testing of awareness, including explicit and implicit learning using a computer and headphones, with b) continuous real-time electroencephalography(EEG) and cerebral oxygenation(rSO) monitoring into CPR during in-hospital CA (IHCA). Survivors underwent interviews to examine for recall of awareness and cognitive experiences. A complementary cross-sectional community CA study provided added insights regarding survivors' experiences.\nRESULTS: Of 567 IHCA, 53(9.3%) survived, 28 of these (52.8%) completed interviews, and 11(39.3%) reported CA memories/perceptions suggestive of consciousness. Four categories of experiences emerged: 1) emergence from coma during CPR (CPR-induced consciousness [CPRIC]) 2/28(7.1%), or 2) in the post-resuscitation period 2/28(7.1%), 3) dream-like experiences 3/28(10.7%), 4) transcendent recalled experience of death (RED) 6/28(21.4%). In the cross-sectional arm, 126 community CA survivors' experiences reinforced these categories and identified another: delusions (misattribution of medical events). Low survival limited the ability to examine for implicit learning. Nobody identified the visual image, 1/28(3.5%) identified the auditory stimulus. Despite marked cerebral ischemia (Mean rSO = 43%) normal EEG activity (delta, theta and alpha) consistent with consciousness emerged as long as 35-60 minutes into CPR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consciousness. awareness and cognitive processes may occur during CA. The emergence of normal EEG may reflect a resumption of a network-level of cognitive activity, and a biomarker of consciousness, lucidity and RED (authentic \"near-death\" experiences).",

However, experiences of caring for an OHCA survivor are sparsely described. Thus, this study aimed to explore how family caregivers of OHCA survivors experience the potential burden.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using an explorative qualitative approach, six focus group interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 family caregivers of OHCA survivors and analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach inspired by the philosophy of Ricoeur. The OHCA survivors attended a rehabilitation course, and the family caregivers were interviewed as part of the course.Based on the analysis, three themes emerged: (i) feeling unexpectedly alone and invisible; the family caregivers experienced an emotional burden that could not be shared-leading to caregiving being a lonely experience, (ii) fear of loss; the fear of losing a loved one was a constant companion contributing to the burden, and (iii) adjusting to a new everyday life; the family caregivers had difficulties adjusting to living their lives on the premise of the survivors' needs.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study emphasize the burden experienced by family caregivers and how they can be trapped in competing emotions and tensions. The possible caregiver burden following OHCA should be acknowledged. Interventions to reduce the burden should be tested and implemented as part of the clinical care of OHCA survivors and their families.",

We aimed to provide insight into these outcomes at one-year follow-up.\nMETHODS: We assessed outcome of surviving comatose patients after cardiac arrest with RPPs included in the 'treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus after cardiopulmonary resuscitation' (TELSTAR) trial at one-year follow-up, including the CPC for functional neurological outcome, a cognitive assessment, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) for emotional outcomes, and the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) for quality of life. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of more than 1.5 SD below the mean on ≥ 2 (sub)tests within a cognitive domain.\nRESULTS: Fourteen patients were included (median age 58 years, 21% female), of whom 13 had a cognitive impairment. Eleven of 14 were impaired in memory, 9/14 in executive functioning, and 7/14 in attention. The median scores on the HADS and SF-36 were all worse than expected. Based on the CPC alone, 8/14 had a good outcome (CPC 1-2).\nCONCLUSION: Nearly all cardiac arrest survivors with RPPs during the comatose state have cognitive impairments at one-year follow-up. The incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms seem relatively high and quality of life relatively poor, despite 'good' outcomes according to the CPC.",

At three-month follow-up, we evaluated cognitive impairment with a neuropsychological test battery and symptoms of psychopathology were re-assessed using HADS and IES-R. Logistic regression models were applied to examine associations between screening results and outcomes.\nRESULTS: This study included 297 OHCA survivors. During hospitalisation, 65% presented with cognitive impairment, 25% reported symptoms of anxiety, 20% symptoms of depression and 21% symptoms of traumatic distress. At follow-up, 53% reported cognitive impairment, 17% symptoms of anxiety, 15% symptoms of depression and 19% symptoms of traumatic distress. Cognitive impairment during hospitalisation was associated with higher odds (OR (95% CI) 2.55 (1.36-4.75), p = .02) of an unfavorable cognitive outcome at follow-up, and symptoms of psychopathology during hospitalisation were associated with higher odds of psychopathology at follow-up across all three symptom groups; anxiety (6.70 (2.40-18.72), p < .001), depression (4.69 (1.69-13.02), p < .001) and traumatic distress (7.07 (2.67-18.73), p < .001).\nCONCLUSION: OHCA survivors exhibited both cognitive impairment and symptoms of psychopathology during hospitalisation comparable to previous studies, which were associated with unfavorable mental health outcomes at three-month follow-up.",

We aimed to clarify opinions on cognitive screening and rehabilitation, identify barriers and facilitators for implementation in the Netherlands, and arrive at recommendations in this field. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders using the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases checklist. There is broad-based acknowledgement of the relevance of cognitive impairment and a positive attitude regarding early cognitive screening among health professionals and patients. Barriers to implementation include a lack of practical recommendations on how, where and when to screen, insufficient knowledge of cognitive consequences of cardiac arrest, insufficient collaboration and knowledge sharing among different specialties within hospitals, insufficient resources, and insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of screening and therapy to justify financial compensation. Most of the identified barriers to implementation are solvable: national guidelines need practical recommendations and knowledge gaps among healthcare workers can be bridged by in-hospital collaboration. Fulfilling these requirements should be sufficient for the implementation of simple screening and tailored advice. More extensive cognitive rehabilitation therapy needs stronger evidence of efficacy in order to warrant stronger guideline recommendations and financial reimbursement.",

The DALY due to pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States is unknown. We aimed to estimate pediatric OHCA DALY and to compare it with the other leading causes of pediatric death and disability in the United States.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of the national Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival database. DALY were calculated as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. Years of life lost were calculated using all pediatric (age <18 years) nontraumatic OHCA from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival from 2016 to 2020. Disability weights based on cerebral performance category scores, an outcome measure of neurologic function, were used to estimate years lived with disability . Data were reported as total, mean, and rate per 100 000 individuals, and were compared with the leading causes of pediatric DALY in the United States published by the Global Burden of Disease study for 2019.\nRESULTS: Totally 11 177 OHCA met the study inclusion criteria. A modest increase in total OHCA DALY in the United States was observed from 407 500 (years of life lost = 407 435 and years lived with disability =65) in 2016 to 415 113 (years of life lost = 415 055 and years lived with disability =58) in 2020. The DALY rate increased from 553.3 per 100 000 individuals in 2016 to 568.3 per 100 000 individuals in 2020. For 2019, OHCA was the 10th leading cause of pediatric DALY lost behind neonatal disorders, injuries, mental disorders, premature birth, musculoskeletal disorders, congenital birth defects, skin diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and asthma.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nontraumatic OHCA is one of the top 10 leading causes of annual pediatric DALY lost in the United States.",

DALY were calculated as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. The years of life lost were calculated using all adult IHCA with complete data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database for 2015 to 2019. Cerebral performance category scores and published disability weights were used to estimate the years lived with disability for survivors. The cohort's DALY were extrapolated to a national level to estimate the total United States DALY and were compared with a published ranking of the leading causes of DALY in the United States for 2018. Data were reported as DALY total and rate per 100,000. A total of 99,897 IHCA were included from 329 hospitals. The total IHCA DALY increased from 2,208,310 in 2015 to 2,225,722 in 2019. A modest decrease in the DALY rate was observed from 689 per 100,000 in 2015 to 678 per 100,000 in 2019. In 2018, the rate of IHCA DALY were 728 per 100,000, which represented the 11th leading cause of DALY. When combined with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (1,322 per 100,000), sudden cardiac arrest (2,050 per 100,000) was found the be the 2nd leading cause of DALY after ischemic heart disease (2,681 per 100,000) in 2018. In conclusion, adult IHCA is a leading cause of DALY in the United States and has increased over time because of the expansion of the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database.",

Caregivers are important in the survivor's recovery, yet there is little research specifically focused on their experiences once the survivor is discharged home. In this study, we highlight how caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors described and experienced their caregiver role, the strategies they used to fulfill their role, and the additional needs they still have years after the IHCA event. Methods and Results Between March and July 2019, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 12 caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors. Interviews were transcribed, and content analysis was performed. Patterns within the data were further analyzed and grouped into themes. A predominant theme of \"disruption\" was identified across 3 different domains including the following: (1) disruption in caregiver's life, (2) disruption in caregiver-patient relationship, and (3) disruption in caregiver's well-being. Disruption was associated with both positive and negative caregiver experiences. Strategies caregivers used and resources they felt would have helped them adjust to their caregiver role were also identified. Conclusions Caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors experienced a disruption in many facets of their lives. Caregivers felt the veterans' IHCA impacted various aspects of their lives, and they continued to need additional support in order to care for the IHCA survivor and themselves. Although some were able to procure coping strategies, such as counseling and engaging in stress-relieving activities, most indicated additional help and resources were still needed.",

Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether symptoms of insomnia are associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors six months after the event.\nMETHODS: This multicentre cross-sectional survey included cardiac arrest survivors ≥18 years. Participants were recruited six months after the event from five hospitals in southern Sweden, and completed a questionnaire including the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale, EQ-5D-5L, Health Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, linear regression, and ordinal logistic regression. The regression analyses were adjusted for demographic and medical factors.\nRESULTS: In total, 212 survivors, 76.4% males, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD = 11.9) were included, and of those, 20% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia was significantly associated with all aspects of self-reported health ( < 0.01) and life satisfaction ( < 0.001), except mobility ( = 0.093), self-care ( = 0.676), and usual activities ( = 0.073).\nCONCLUSION: Insomnia plays a potentially important role for both health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening for sleep problems should be part of post cardiac arrest care and follow-up to identify those in need of further medical examination and treatment.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most cardiac arrest (CA) survivors report good health and quality of life. Life satisfaction on the other hand has not yet been studied in a large scale in the CA population. We aimed to explore life satisfaction as perceived by CA survivors with three research questions addressed: (1) how do CA survivors report their life satisfaction, (2) how are different domains of life satisfaction associated with overall life satisfaction, and (3) how are demographic and medical factors associated with overall life satisfaction?\nMETHODS: This registry study had a cross-sectional design. Life satisfaction was assessed using the 11-item Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11). The sample included 1435 survivors ≥18 years of age. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were used.\nRESULTS: Survivors were most satisfied with partner relation (85.6%), family life (82.2%), and self-care (77.8%), while 60.5% were satisfied with overall life. Satisfaction with psychological health was strongest associated with overall life satisfaction. Among medical and demographic factors, female sex and poor cerebral performance were associated with less overall life satisfaction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Generally, CA survivors seem to perceive similar levels of overall life satisfaction as general populations, while survivors tend to be significantly less satisfied with their sexual life. Satisfaction with psychological health is of special interest to identify and treat. Additionally, female survivors and survivors with poor neurological outcome are at risk for poorer overall life satisfaction and need special attention by healthcare professionals.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Allocating resources to increase survival after cardiac arrest requires survivors to have a good quality of life, but long-term data are lacking.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2019.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the health-related quality of life of all adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry between June 1, 2001, and August 31, 2019, who were alive in October 2020 (follow-up periods, 0-1, >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, >10-15, and >15-20 years since arrest). The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.\nEXPOSURE: All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.\nRESULTS: Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population. These findings support resource allocation and efforts targeted to increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",

Family members, acting as surrogate decision makers, are frequently asked to decide whether the patient should continue to receive ongoing life-sustaining therapy such as mechanical ventilation in this context of risk of death following removal. Sometimes, physicians and family members disagree about what is in the patient's best interest, and this conflict causes distress for both families and medical personnel.This article examines themes recorded in the medical records of 24 cardiac arrest patients at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) whose families chose to pursue continued life support despite physician recommendations for withdrawal. In documented conversations between patients' families and their providers, the most prominent themes included faith in miracles, the inappropriateness of \"playing God,\" the value of more time with the patient, and differences in how providers and family members perceived the patient's status.",

We assessed their preferences toward needs during hospitalization and beyond to inform intervention development.\nMETHODS: Through an online survey developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, cardiac arrest survivors, and families, adult close family members recruited through advocacy organizations ranked top choice among 8 unique interventions addressing either information-based needs (n = 4) or well-being needs (n = 4). Logistic Regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations of family members' attributes, caregiving characteristics, and survivors' hospitalization factors with two intervention groups.\nRESULTS: Of 657 responses received, ranking data of 550 close family members (59% between 18-40 years of age, 65% female, 51% of minority race/ethnicity, 53% partners, provided a median of 8 hours of caregiving, for a median of 4.5 months) were analyzed. Information needs were the more commonly preferred intervention group (63%; n = 347), with education on the potential recovery of survivors ranking first (28%; n = 149). In a multivariate model, family members age >40 years, families witnessing the cardiac arrest, assuming the caregiver role either during hospitalization or within one month of hospital discharge, and discharging directly to home were significantly associated with prioritizing information needs over well-being needs, after adjusting for sex, race, intensity, and duration of caregiving.\nCONCLUSIONS: Interventions focusing on information needs are among the top priorities for families of cardiac arrest survivors. Prospective studies testing these hypotheses-generating findings are needed to inform further intervention development.",

We measured quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Levels questionnaire. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders were common among patients with good neurologic recovery. There were 23 patients who experienced cognitive impairments (23.7%) and 28 who suffered from mood disorders (28.9%). Age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12), mood disorders (adjusted OR 22.80, 95% CI 4.84-107.49) and hospital length of stay (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive impairments (adjusted OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.83-35.97) and non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 11.51, 95% CI 3.15-42.15) were risk factors for mood disorders. Quality of life was significantly lower in the OHCA survivors with each disorder than the healthy individuals. Routine screening and intervention are needed for OHCA survivors.",

Data collection and analysis using the seven stages of hermeneutic analysis described by Diekelman. Data were collected through semi-structured personal interviews with open-ended questions.\nRESULTS: Analysis revealed five themes: 'The unexpected attack', 'Experiencing a different world: Transformation of Body, Time, Emotion and Sensation', 'Restoration of the re-embodied self', 'Life transformation' and 'Personal transformation'. The themes are commensurate with transcultural components of Near-Death Experiences. Surviving out of hospital cardiac arrest was perceived as a 'divine gift' and a chance to continue 'living in a more conscious and meaningful way'. Despite participants' physical and psychosocial challenges, the narratives highlighted a newly acquired deep appreciation for the joy of life, living and others. Construction of meaning and a heightened spirituality seem central in reconstructing life after out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors reflected and described in-depth on their lived experiences of out of hospital cardiac arrest through a 60- to 90-min interview. In addition, the participants provided their feedback on the interpretation of the findings, confirmed the study findings, and ensured that the analysis reflected aspects of their individual experiences and were true to them.",

We aimed to describe and compare the use of healthcare by OHCA survivors two years before and one year after cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: Adult patients with OHCA of medical cause, who survived >30 days, were identified in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry. The Norwegian Patient Registry, The Cause of Death Registry, and The Norwegian Registry for Primary Healthcare provided data on survival and the use of healthcare services. We investigated the use of primary, specialist and mental healthcare, as well as rehabilitation services.\nRESULTS: In 2015-2018, 13,112 OHCA cases were identified; 1435 (14%) patients survived >30 days (6.8/100,000 patients/year). The proportion of patients in the cohort that used primary healthcare each month increased form 43% before to 69% after OHCA to (p < 0.001). We found a doubling of monthly healthcare contacts in specialist healthcare (from 26% to 57%, p < 0.001) and yearly contacts for mental healthcare (from 3% to 8%, p > 0.001). The observed increases in primary, specialist and mental healthcare use started two weeks, six months, and eight months before OHCA, respectively. Half of the patients had contact with primary healthcare services on the same day as the cardiac arrest. Two out of five patients were registered for rehabilitation after OHCA.\nCONCLUSION: The use of primary, specialist and mental healthcare services increased before OHCA and remained significantly higher the year after OHCA. Less than half of the patients surviving cardiac arrest were registered for rehabilitation.",

To address this critical practice gap, we plan a mixed-methods study to co-produce and evaluate a new cardiac arrest-specific patient/survivor-reported outcome measure (PROM).\nMETHODS: International guidelines have informed a two-stage, iterative, and interactive process.Stage one will establish what is important to measure following cardiac arrest. A meta-ethnography of published qualitative research and a qualitative exploration of the experiences of survivors and their key supporters will inform the development of a measurement framework. This will be supplemented by existing, extensive reviews describing concepts that have previously been measured in this population. Focus groups with survivors, key supporters, and healthcare professionals, followed by further interviews with survivors and key supporters, will inform the iterative refinement of the framework, candidate items, and PROM structure.Stage two will involve a psychometric evaluation following completion by a large cohort of survivors. Measurement theory will inform: the identification of items that best measure important outcomes; item reduction; and provide robust evidence of measurement and practical properties.\nDISCUSSION: An international, collaborative approach to PROM development will engage survivors, key supporters, researchers, and health professionals from study commencement. Successful co-production of the cardiac arrest survivorship and health-related quality of life (CASHQoL) measure will provide a robust, relevant, and internationally applicable measure, suitable for completion by adult survivors, and integration into research, registries, and routine care settings.Ethical approval: University of Warwick Biomedical & Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 22/20-21 granted 10/11/20).",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrest is a rare event in children and adolescents. Those who survive may experience a range of outcomes, from good functional recovery to severe and permanent disability. Many children experience long-term cognitive impairment, including deficits in attention, language, memory, and executive functioning. Deficits in adaptive behavior, such as motor functioning, communication, and daily living skills, have also been reported. These children have a wide range of neurological outcomes, with some experiencing specific deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, and sensorimotor deficits. Some children may experience emotional and psychological difficulties, although many do not, and more research is needed in this area. The burden of pediatric cardiac arrest on the child's family and caregivers can be substantial. This narrative review summarizes current research regarding the cognitive and psychological outcomes following pediatric cardiac arrest, identifies areas for future research, and discusses the needs of these children for rehabilitation services and academic accommodations.",

Hence, we investigated these problems in survivors 1-5 years post-OHCA and whether the results are different at different time points post-OHCA.\nMETHODS: All adults who survived an OHCA in Denmark from 2016 to 2019 were identified using the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry and invited to participate in a survey between October 2020 and March 2021. The survey included the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, \"Two simple questions\" (everyday activities and mental recovery), and the 12-item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. To investigate results at different time points, survivors were divided into four time-groups (12-24, 25-36, 37-48 and 49-56 months post-OHCA). Differences between time-groups were determined using the Kruskall-Wallis test for the mean scores and Chi-square test for the proportion of survivors with symptoms.\nRESULTS: Total eligible survey population was 2116, of which 1258 survivors (60 %) responded. Overall, 29 % of survivors reported fatigue, 20 % anxiety, 15 % depression, and 27 % disability. When survivors were sub-divided by time since OHCA, no significant difference was found on either means scores or proportion between time groups (p = 0.28 to 0.88).\nCONCLUSION: Up to a third of survivors report fatigue, anxiety, depression, reduced mental function and disability 1-5 years after OHCA. This proportion is the same regardless of how much time has passed supporting early screening and tailored post-OHCA interventions to help survivors adapt to their new situation.",

The aim was to describe longitudinal variations in grief reactions and its association with professional and social support among bereaved family members after a close person's death from sudden CA.\nMETHODS: This longitudinal multimethod survey included 69 bereaved family members who completed a questionnaire 6 and 12-months after the CA, including the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Qualitative data were collected by open-ended questions. Quantitative data was analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression analysis while written comments were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.\nRESULTS: The median age was 62 years, 67 % were women, and 38 % had been present during the resuscitation attempts. Using the cut-off scores at the 6- and 12-month assessments respectively, 14 % and 17 % reported symptoms of prolonged grief, 32 % and 26 % symptoms of anxiety, 14 % and 9 % depression, and 4 % and 1 % posttraumatic stress. Professional and social support at the 6-month assessment were significantly associated with symptoms of prolonged grief, anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress at the 12-month assessments but could not predict any changes in the grief reactions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Family members' grief reactions point to the importance of proactive and available support over time to meet family members' needs.",

The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.\nMETHODS: Patients aged ≥ 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\nRESULTS: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, respectively, p-value < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and poorer general health.",

Outcomes included the modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Euro-Quality of Life 5 Dimension 5 Level, return to work and hospital readmissions. Forty-eight patients (80%) consented to follow-up interviews. The mean age of participants was 67.2 (± 15.3) years, and 33 of 48 (68.8%) were male. Good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 3) was reported by 31 of 37 participants (83.8%) at 6 months and 30 of 33 (90.9%) at 12 months. The median Euro-Quality of Life-5D index value was 0.73 (0.33-0.84) at 6 months and 0.76 (0.47-0.88) at 12 months. The median Euro-Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale score at 6 months was 70 (55-80) and 75 (50-87.5) at 12 months. Problems in all Euro-Quality of Life-5D-5 L dimension were reported frequently at both time points. Hospital readmission was reported by 23 of 37 patients (62.2%) at 6 months and 16 of 33 (48.5%) at 12 months. Less than half of previously working participants had returned to work by 12 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors had a good functional outcome and health-related quality of life at 6 months, and this was largely unchanged at 12 months. Despite this, many reported problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression. Return to work rates was low, and hospital readmissions were common.",

Among hospital-discharge survivors, the 3-year end point of mortality or mortality and all-cause readmission was examined with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression model for predictors. The use of publicly funded home care and community services within 1 year after discharge also was evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of the 10,674 linked, emergency medical services-treated adult OHCAs, 3230 were admitted to hospital and 1325 survived to hospital discharge. At 3 years after discharge, the estimated Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 84.1% (95% CI 81.7%-86.1%) and freedom from death or all-cause readmission was 31.8% (29.0%-34.7%). After exclusions, 26.6% (n = 315/1186) accessed residential or home care services within 1 year. Independent predictors of long-term outcomes included age and comorbidities, but also favourable arrest characteristics and in-hospital factors such as revascularization or receipt of an intracardiac defibrillator before discharge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among OHCA hospital survivors, the long-term death or readmission risk persists and is modulated by both pre- and in-hospital factors. However, only 1 in 4 survivors required residential or home care after discharge. These results support efforts to improve care processes to increase survival to hospital discharge.",

This systematic review aimed to summarize long-term outcomes (1 year and beyond), including overall survival, survival with favorable neurological outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes) amongst pediatric OHCA patients who survived to discharge. Embase, Medline, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 6, 2021. Studies were included if they reported outcomes at 1 year or beyond after pediatric OHCA. Data abstraction and quality assessment was conducted by three authors independently. Qualitative outcomes were reported systematically. Seven studies were included, and amongst patients that survived to hospital discharge or to 30 days, longer-term survival was at least 95% at 24 months of follow up. A highly variable proportion (range 10-71%) of patients had favorable neurological outcomes at 24 months of follow up. With regard to health-related quality of life outcomes, at a time point distal to 1 year, at least 60% of pediatric non-traumatic OHCA patients were reported to have good outcomes. Our study found that at least 95% of pediatric OHCA patients, who survived to discharge, survived to a time point distal to 1 year. There is a general paucity of data surrounding the pediatric OHCA population.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Few studies have focused on mid/long-term neurological changes in out-of- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Some studies suggest that there is still a slow, small, progressive improvement in cognitive function and quality of life for this population, even in the mid/long term. However, clinical data focused on mid/long-term outcomes for OHCA patients are still lacking. This study aimed to assess mid-term neurological changes in OHCA patients. We summarized patients' improved or worsened neurological changes between 30 and 90 days. Then we identified the relationship between clinical variables and 30- to 90-day neurological improvement.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of data (Jun 2014 - Dec 2017) from a Japanese nationwide OHCA registry was conducted. Inclusion criteria were OHCA patients ≥18 years old. Exclusion criteria were death within 30 days and missing Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 30 and 90 days. We described the distributions of 30-day and 90-day CPC scores as well as the number and portion of patients whose CPC scores improved and worsened between 30 and 90 days. Additionally, factors affecting improved neurological changes over the time period were examined using multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of the registry's 34,745 patients, 1868 were analyzed. Favorable neurological outcomes (CPC scores of 1 and 2) were seen in 1020/1868 patients at 90 days. CPC scores at 90 days were: CPC 1: 866 (46%), CPC 2: 154 (8.2%), CPC 3: 224 (12%), and CPC 4: 392 (20%), respectively. A total of 232 patients (CPC 5: 12%) died between 30 and 90 days. In 133 patients (7%), 90-day CPC scores improved compared to their 30-day scores. In 260 patients (14%), 90-day CPC scores worsened compared with their 30-day scores. Application of target temperature management was an independent factor for 30- to 90-day neurological improvement (adjusted odds ratio: 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.68).\nCONCLUSIONS: In our nationwide registry, 7% of resuscitated patients had improved neurological changes in the 30- to 90-day period; most of the improvements were CPC scores improving from 2 to 1. Target temperature management was an independent factor associated with CPC improvement over the 30- to 90-day period.",

In this longitudinal survey study, we evaluated associations between mindfulness, baseline psychological symptoms, and 1-year psychological symptoms in long-term CA survivors. We collected demographic and CA characteristics at baseline. At both timepoints, we assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) through the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) and depression and anxiety symptoms through the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). At follow-up, we assessed mindfulness through the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R). We used adjusted linear regression to predict 1-year PCL-5 and PHQ-4 scores, with particular consideration of the CAMS-R as a cross-sectional correlate of outcome. We included 129 CA survivors (mean age: 52 years, 52% male, 98% white). At 1-year follow-up, in adjusted models, CAMS-R (β: -0.35, p < 0.001) and baseline PCL-5 scores (β: 0.56, p < 0.001) were associated with 1-year PCL-5 scores. CAMS-R (β: -0.34, p < 0.001) and baseline PHQ-4 scores were associated with 1-year PHQ-4 scores (β: 0.37, p < 0.001). In conclusion, mindfulness was inversely associated with psychological symptoms in long-term CA survivors. Future studies should examine the longitudinal relationship of mindfulness and psychological symptoms after CA.",

Our aim was to investigate PICS in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, we assessed risks for PICS at 3 and 12-month follow-up within the following domains: a) physical impairment (EuroQol [EQ-5D-3L]), b) cognitive functioning (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] score >1, modified Rankin Scale [mRS] >2) and c) psychological burden (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]).\nRESULTS: At 3 months, 69/139 patients (50%) met the definition of PICS including 37% in the physical domain, 25% in the cognitive domain and 13% in the psychological domain. Intubation (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.1 to 5,0 p = 0.03), sedatives (OR 3.4, 95%CI 1 to 11, p = 0.045), mRS at discharge (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.70 to 11.01, p = 0.002), CPC at discharge (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.4 to 7.6, p = 0.005) and post-discharge work loss (OR 13.4, 95%CI 1.7 to 107.5, p = 0.014) were significantly associated with PICS. At 12 months, 52/110 (47%) patients had PICS, which was associated with prolonged duration of rehabilitation, higher APACHE scores, and higher mRS and CPC scores at hospital discharge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of long-term OHCA survivors show PICS after 3 and 12 months. These high numbers call for more emphasis on appropriate screening and treatment in this patient population. Future studies should evaluate whether early identification of these patients enables preventive strategies and treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Background Cardiac arrest survivorship refers to the lived experience of long-term survivors of cardiac arrest and the many postdischarge challenges they experience. We aimed to gather a nuanced understanding of these challenges and of survivors' perceptions of ways to improve the recovery process. Methods and Results We conducted 15 semistructured, one-on-one interviews with cardiac arrest survivor members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation; the interviews were conducted by telephone and recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis, informed by the Framework Method, to identify underlying themes regarding cardiac arrest survivorship challenges and recommendations to improve cardiac arrest survivorship. Regarding challenges, the overarching theme was a feeling of unpreparedness to confront postarrest challenges because of lack of resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Regarding recommendations, we uncovered 3 overarching themes including systemic recommendations (eg, providing appropriate resources and expectations, educating providers about survivorship, following up with survivors, including caregivers in treatment planning), social recommendations (eg, attending peer support groups, spending time with loved ones, providing support resources for family members), and individual coping recommendations (eg, acceptance, resilience, regaining control, seeking treatment, focusing on meaning and purpose). Conclusions We described common challenges that survivors of cardiac arrest face, such as lacking resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Additionally, we identified promising pathways that may improve cardiac arrest survivorship at systemic, social, and individual coping levels. Future studies could use our findings as targets for interventions to support and improve survivorship.",

The studies excluded were those involving the pediatric population (<age 16), written in a language other than English, and studies with no mention of outcomes. The literature search was done by PubMed and EBSCOhost databases from the oldest available literature through November 2019. Due to the scarcity of published literature and a qualitative description of outcomes, a narrative review of the literature was deemed appropriate. Seven case reports and one retrospective cohort study met the inclusion criteria. Cognitive and visual impairments were significant barriers to rehabilitation in CB. Improvement of visual deficits occurred within one to two months. Those with complete blindness, cognitive impairments, and a delay in resuscitation were more likely to have poorer functional outcomes in the performance of activities of daily living and were less likely to be discharged home. This is the most comprehensive review of published literature to focus on the function of patients with cortical blindness. The limitations include the small number of published literature and the qualitative approach utilized. Despite the limitations, the findings of this review can inform future studies that would investigate the most efficient and comprehensive methods of CB rehabilitation.",

At discharge, 60% were on paid sick leave, and 20% at 12 months. Age (per one year older) increased the odds of experiencing the composite endpoint at 3 and 12 months (3 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.10, 12 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.09) among the total population (n = 184). Self-reported health at discharge was not associated with the endpoint.\nCONCLUSION: One-fifth of the OHCA survivors at a working-age prior to the OHCA was still on paid sick leave after 12 months. Increasing age was the only characteristic associated with a composite endpoint of prolonged sick leave or leaving the workforce at 3 and 12 months after discharge. With increasing survival rates, healthcare professionals need to support the population in resuming daily life, including returning to the workforce, when relevant.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia, sleep apnoea and sleep loss are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Most research on sleep disturbances includes patients with heart failure, while the role of sleep in sudden cardiac arrest survivors (SCA) has been only partially investigated and understood. Sleep-related breathing disorders and obstructive sleep apnoea increase illness and mortality in the aftermath of SCA. Also, post-traumatic stress is evident in SCA survivors, where sleep disruptions are some of the main symptoms of the condition. Consequently, it is important to identify sleep problems in SCA survivors at an early stage to avoid unnecessary suffering.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate registered nurses' perceptions of SCA survivors' sleep, both in hospital and after discharge.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was an explorative interview study with a phenomenographic approach. Nineteen registered nurses (RNs) varying in age, sex and years in the profession participated.\nFINDINGS: The nurses' perceptions of SCA survivors' sleep were categorized as: \"The observer - noticing behaviours, emotions and habits of the patient that affect sleep\", \"The oblivious witness - attitudes that hinder the ability to recognise sleep behaviours\", and \"The practitioner - advising and medicating for sleep\". The outcome space showed that the nurses detected both obvious and subtle signs relating to patients' sleep. However, attitudes hindering the recognition of sleep behaviours were independent of acting as an observer or practitioner. If nothing unforeseen was observed, or if the patient did not spontaneously raise the subject, sleep was considered less important than other health problems in SCA survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the nurses knew that SCA survivors suffered from poor sleep, they failed to reflect on the consequences for the patient. Nurses' feelings of insufficient knowledge about sleep, as well as their omittance of sleep in the follow-up documentation could leave sleep issues unaddressed and cause unnecessary patient suffering.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need increased knowledge and training to enable them to detect subtle signs of sleep problems in SCA survivors.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been increasing interest in examining how cardiac arrest survivors and their families experience life after sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Understanding their experiences provides a basis to study tools and interventions to improve short- and long-term recovery and rehabilitation.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Qualitative interview and survey-style studies explored the lived experience of SCA survivors and revealed common themes (e.g., need for recovery expectations and long-term follow-up resources). A heightened awareness for the unique needs of family and loved ones of survivors led to qualitative studies focusing on these members as well. Methodology papers published portend prospective assessment and follow-up cohort studies. However, no investigations evaluating discharge processes or specific interventions directed at domain impairments common after SCA were identified in the review period. International work continues to identify patient and family-centered priorities for outcome measurement and research.\nSUMMARY: In line with increased recognition of the importance for recovery and rehabilitation after SCA, there has been a commensurate increase in investigations documenting the needs of survivors and families surviving SCA. Pediatric and underserved populations continue to be understudied with regards to recovery after SCA.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When surviving a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving may be present for months or years. The survivors' family and colleagues are also highly affected by the incident. There is little knowledge about experiences of surviving SCA in individuals who prior to the incident were young and reported to exercise regularly. Consequently, the aim of this study was to explore the aftermath of surviving a SCA in young, regular exercisers.\nMETHODS: The study had a qualitative design, conducting in-depth individual interviews with SCA survivors < 50 years of age reporting to exercise ≥ 5 h/week and/or who suffered SCA during or less than 60 min after exercise. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation in-line with recommendations from Malterud.\nRESULTS: 18 of 31 eligible participants were included in the study. Through analysis we identified 'Establishing a new everyday life' as superordinate category, with subordinate categories a) being part of my surroundings, b) expecting normality but facing a new reality and c) lucky to be alive!\nCONCLUSION: This study adds knowledge about young and regular exercisers' experiences after surviving a SCA. The obligations of everyday life in young survivors of SCA often imply a high work load and complex tasks, e.g. due to being in the beginning of their career or even still studying. Healthcare personnel, as well as the society, need to acknowledge that although lucky to be alive and apparently well-functioning, young survivors of SCA may have persistent challenges that cause frustration and reduced quality of life.",

Comprehensive assessments of family experiences and support needs after SABI are lacking. Our objective is to elicit \"on-the-ground\" perspectives about the experiences and needs of families of patients with SABI.\nDESIGN: Two-phase qualitative study of families and multidisciplinary U.S. healthcare professionals (mHCPs) with expertise in SABI: Phase 1 included semistructured interviews to generate formative findings; phase 2 entailed facilitated discussions to confirm and expand initial findings.\nSETTING: Phase 1: academic medical center; phase 2: virtual workshop.\nSUBJECTS: Phase 1 included seven family members and 12 mHCPs. Phase 2 included nationally recruited stakeholders (17 family members and 12 mHCPs).\nINTERVENTION: None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We explored: 1) what are families' needs in the first 48 hours? 2) How are these needs addressed? and 3) How can hospitals better meet these needs? Qualitative analysis included inductive and deductive approaches guided by a conceptual ecological model. Four major needs were identified: 1) challenges in coping with uncertainty in early prognostication, 2) inattention to physical needs of family, 3) deficits in compassionate and consistent communication, and 4) need for engagement with families as stakeholders in improving future practices. Participants' recommendations included: 1) ways to communicate more clearly and consistently, 2) better assistance with navigating resources and access to places for families to care for themselves, and 3) opportunities for families to remain connected with their loved ones, social support networks, and the clinical team.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders identified novel insights regarding families' experiences during the hospitalization of comatose SABI patients and factors that can contribute to improved decision-making and physical/emotional outcomes. Interventions to address these unmet needs are promising targets to improve outcomes.",

Identifying factors persistently impacting the quality of life after CA is crucial to improve long-term outcomes.\nMETHODS: Adult in- and out-of-hospital CA patients surviving to hospital discharge between 1996 and 2015 were retrospectively included. We classified survivors in stages of survival time and assessed long-term survival and quality of life by contacting patients via a standardized telephone questionnaire including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).\nRESULTS: Of 4,234 patients, 1,573 (37.2%) survived to hospital discharge. Among those, 693(44.1%) were alive at the time of the interview. We obtained interviews in 178 patients at a survival time of 7.8 (4.2-12.6) years. Younger age, female gender, and shorter duration of initial hospitalization and coma were associated with long-term survival. Conversely, higher median age at time of CA predicted poor outcome (mRS ≥ 3) and impaired quality of daily life. Around 25% declared being impaired in mobility, with female gender and higher age being predictors. Impairment in personal care and hygiene was stated in 11.8%, and activities of daily life such as shopping troubled 33.1%. Chronic pain impairing daily life was reported in 47.2% of cases, and lower socioeconomic status was suggestive of unfavourable outcome.\nCONCLUSION: Very long-term survivors showed considerable impairment of quality of life in terms of reduced mobility, self-care, or chronic pain. Higher age at time of CA and lower socioeconomic status showed worse outcomes. A more personalized screening of survivors for risk factors and long-term support are suggested.",

Data consisted of semistructured interviews with 12 relatives of OHCA survivors. We analyzed data based on Paul Ricoeur's theory of interpretation.\nRESULTS: Relatives experienced OHCA as an abrupt and stressful event filled with imposing concerns for the cardiac arrest survivor. Relatives were fellow sufferers confronted with the possibility of bereavement, watching from the sideline with fearful eyes. After the OHCA, relatives experienced a troubled time with anxiety and edginess, monitoring the survivor for signs of a new cardiac arrest and trying to adapt to a new normality. Relatives' previous identities and positions within their families were disrupted.\nCONCLUSION: Relatives were challenged with the OHCA and the trajectory after it, experiencing a high level of distress and anxiety. Relatives took on an immense responsibility, always watching the survivor for potential symptoms of a new cardiac arrest. The cardiac arrest and the survivor's possible cognitive impairments gave rise to assuming a new authority as a relative. We advocate for a new family approach to relatives, acknowledging relatives' stress and central role in supporting cardiac arrest survivors.",

Organizational factors of potential importance to service provision were considered: health care region, size of catchment area/population, type of department/municipality and socioeconomic index.\nRESULTS: Response rates for the provision of each core component of cardiac rehabilitation ranged from 64% to 98%. All hospitals and municipalities provided some aspect of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest. Across hospitals, provision of four core components of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was lower compared with post acute myocardial infarction patients: patient education (relative risk (RR) = 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.75)), exercise training (RR = 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.98)), screening for anxiety and depression (RR = 0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) and nutritional counselling RR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.93)). No difference was found in the provision of core components across municipalities. Overall, the provision of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was not affected by organizational factors.\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates a need for future research to inform the development, adoption and implementation of equal access to all components of cardiac rehabilitation for survivors of cardiac arrest in Denmark.",

Participants provided demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models.\nRESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (β: -0.35 to -0.53, p < .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in survivors and informal caregivers. Further study is needed to validate these findings in a larger, representative sample.",

Caregivers of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were used as controls.\nMETHODS: Data were collected from the cognitive substudy of the Targeted Temperature Management-trial. Caregiver burden was assessed with the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview, with scores ≤20 considered as no burden. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF-36v2®, with T-scores 47-53 representing the norm. Cardiac arrest survivors were categorized based on the results from cognitive assessments as having \"no cognitive impairment\" or \"cognitive impairment\".\nRESULTS: Follow-up 6 months post event was performed for caregivers of 272 cardiac arrest survivors and 108 matched myocardial infarction controls, included at an intended ratio of 2:1. In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and controls reported similar caregiver burden. The overall scores for quality of life were within normative levels and similar for caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and control patients. Compared to those with no cognitive impairment, caregivers of cognitively impaired cardiac arrest survivors (n = 126) reported higher levels of burden (median 18 versus 8, p < 0.001) and worse quality of life in five of eight domains, particularly \"Role-Emotional\" (mean 45.7 versus 49.5, p = 0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and myocardial infarction controls reported similar levels of burden and quality of life.

The research question was \"how do relatives of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors experience collaboration and communication with healthcare professionals, and what is emphasized as important in the transition from hospital to daily life\".\nDESIGN: Qualitative design.\nMETHODS: Six semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 23 relatives of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who participated in a residential rehabilitation course. Data was collected between November 2018 and March 2019. Transcripts were analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach.\nRESULTS: The analysis generated three themes \"a necessary presence,\" \"communication with healthcare professionals on the cardiac ward\" and \"the abrupt disappearance of the system.\" Relatives of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors feel a great responsibility when coping and adjusting to their new life. In the transition to daily life, a focus on systematic involvement and collaboration with relatives should be an essential part of the post-cardiac arrest pathway.",

To adjust to and manage daily life is critical, and therefore a tailored rehabiliation programme was introduced to the participants. The study aimed to explore the lived experience among cardiac arrest survivors.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Data were gathered through six focus group interviews during a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. Thirty-three out-of-hospital SCA survivors (8 women and 25 men) participated. Time since cardiac arrest was on average 12-57 months. An exploratory qualitative design inspired by Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutics was applied. Two main themes emerged from the analysis and interpretation: (i) a lack of support from the health system in the transition from hospital to daily life; and (ii) feeling understood for the first time. The findings revealed that out-of-hospital SCA survivors experience a knowledge gap struggling for support. Attending the programme, gaining knowledge and experiencing peer support was described as a revelation for them.\nCONCLUSION: The findings suggest that out-of-hospital SCA survivors felt understood for the first time when attending a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. A post-arrest pathway is needed led by a coordinating cardiac arrest specialist nursing service together with allied healthcare professionals. Focus on hypoxic brain injuries, emotional burdens, and supportive strategies are essential in the transition to daily life. Facilitated peer support is warranted.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive and physical difficulties are common in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA); both survivors and close family members are also at risk of developing mood disorders. In the UK, dedicated follow-up pathways for OHCA survivors and their family are lacking. A cohort of survivors and family members were surveyed regarding their experience of post-discharge care and their recommended improvements.\nMETHOD: 123 OHCA survivors and 39 family members completed questionnaires during an educational event or later online. Questions addressed both the actual follow-up offered and the perceived requirements for optimal follow-up from the patient and family perspective, including consideration of timing, professionals involved, involvement of family members and areas they felt should be covered.\nRESULTS: Outpatient follow-up was commonly arranged after OHCA (77%). This was most often conducted by a cardiologist alone (80%) but survivors suggested that other professionals should also be involved (e.g. psychologist/counsellor, 64%). Topics recommended for consideration included cardiac arrest-related issues (heart disease; cause of arrest) mental fatigue/sleep disturbance, cognitive problems, emotional problems and daily activities. Most survivors advocated an early review (<1month; 61%). Most family members reported some psychological difficulties (95%); many of them (95%) advocated a dedicated follow-up appointment for family members of survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: The majority of OHCA survivors advocated an early follow-up following hospital discharge and a holistic, multidimensional assessment of arrest sequelae. These results suggest that current OHCA follow-up often fails to address patient-centred issues and to provide access to professionals deemed important by survivors and family members.",

We conducted an online survey study between October 29, 2019, and November 15, 2019 with cardiac arrest survivors and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. We queried survivors as to whether they experienced cognitive or psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. Next, we queried both survivors and caregivers on the provision of resources through three metrics: (1) discussions with providers about potential cognitive or psychological symptoms, (2) neurologist or psychologist appointments scheduled by providers, and (3) mental health referrals by providers. We then ran Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to compare the proportion of survivors and caregivers who reported resource provision (observed values) to the proportion of survivors who reported experiencing cognitive and psychological symptoms, respectively (expected values). We included responses from 167 survivors and 52 caregivers. A total of 73.1% ( = 122) survivors reported experiencing cognitive symptoms and 67.1% ( = 112) psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. When compared to these two proportions, provision of resources was significantly lower in all three metrics: (1) fewer discussions with providers about potential for developing cognitive symptoms (31%) and psychological symptoms (26.3%), (2) fewer neurologist appointments scheduled (8.4%) and psychologist appointments scheduled (4.8%), and (3) fewer referrals to mental health (6%). Informal caregivers also reported significantly lower provision of resources in all three metrics, with the exception of discussions about developing cognitive symptoms. Our results suggest that there are discrepancies in the provision of cognitive and psychological resources in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery. Systematic referral processes may be needed to standardize resource provision to consistently meet the pervasive cognitive and psychological needs of cardiac arrest survivors.",

Survival rates have increased over the last decade and many survivors return to their communities. IHCA has been recognized as a unique disease entity because the arrest happens in a medical care setting and survivors often have more medical co-morbidities. Although more individuals are surviving IHCA, very little is known about their long-term recovery experiences. Semi-structured interviews with 19 IHCA survivors were conducted to better understand their recovery experiences and identify strategies of adaptation that they felt aided their recovery. Thematic analysis indicated that IHCA survivors experience ongoing challenges to recovery. Reconceptualization of independence was necessary for some participants to re-engage in social and physical activities and a few were able to engage in new activities. Our findings suggest that IHCA survivors often develop their own strategies for adaptation in order to continue participation in their social lives and that their recovery experiences are ongoing. Intervention programs and follow-up care should continuously ask survivors what is important to them and identify resources that will support their goals. Questions should include physical, cognitive, psychological and social goals that extend beyond those specifically related to IHCA since our findings indicate that the effects of IHCA are long-lasting and encompass all aspects of survivors' lives.",

The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nMETHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nRESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5).\nDISCUSSION: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL.",

Absolute probabilities were estimated using logistic regression for 1-year outcomes and cause-specific Cox regression for 5-year outcomes. Differences between income-groups were standardized with respect to age, sex, education and comorbidities.\nRESULTS: High-income compared to low-income patients had highest 1-year (96.4% vs. 84.2%) and 5-year (87.6% vs. 64.1%) survival, and lowest 1-year (11.3% vs. 7.4%) and 5-year (13.7% vs. 8.6%) risk of anoxic brain damage/nursing home admission. The corresponding standardized probability differences were 8.2% (95%CI 4.7-11.6%) and 13.9% (95%CI 8.2-19.7%) for 1- and 5-year survival, respectively; and -4.5% (95%CI -8.2 to -1.2%) and -5.1% (95%CI -9.3 to -0.9%) for 1- and 5-year risk of anoxic brain damage/nursing home admission, respectively. Among 831 patients < 66 years working prior to OHCA, 72.1% returned to work within 1 year and 80.8% within 5 years. High-income compared to low-income patients had the highest chance of 1-year (76.4% vs. 58.8%) and 5-year (85.3% vs. 70.6%) return to work with the corresponding absolute probability difference of 18.0% (95%CI 3.8-32.7%) for 1-year and 9.4% (95%CI -3.4 to 22.3%) for 5-year.\nCONCLUSION: Patients of high socioeconomic status had higher probability of long-term survival and return to work, and lower risk of anoxic brain damage/nursing home admission after OHCA compared to patients of low socioeconomic status.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors is increasing. However, there remains limited knowledge on the long-term physical and psychological problems suffered by survivors and their relatives. The aims of the DANCAS (DANish cardiac arrest survivorship) survey are to describe the prevalence of physical and psychological problems, identify predictors associated with suffering them and to determine unmet rehabilitation needs in order to make recommendations on the timing and content of future rehabilitation interventions.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DANCAS survey has a cross-sectional design involving a survey of OHCA survivors and their relatives. OHCA survivors will be identified through the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry as having suffered an OHCA between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019. Each survivor will be asked to identify their closest relative to complete the relatives' survey. Contents of survivor survey: EQ-5D-5Level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Two Simple Questions, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, 12-item WHO Disability Assessment Scale 2.0, plus questions on unmet rehabilitation and information needs. Contents of relatives' survey: World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index. Self-report outcome data collected through the surveys will be enriched by data from Danish national registries including demographic characteristics, circumstances of cardiac arrest and comorbidities. The survey will be completed either electronically or by post December 2020-February 2021.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Surveys and registry-based research studies do not normally require ethical approval in Denmark. This has been confirmed for this study by the Region of Southern Denmark ethics committee (20192000-19). Results of the study will be disseminated via several peer-reviewed publications and will be presented at national and international conferences.",

Further, to explore the association between paediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) and intelligence.\nMETHODS: Prospective longitudinal single center study including children (0-17 years) with OHCA, admitted to the PICU of a tertiary care hospital between 2012 and 2017. Survivors were assessed during an outpatient multidisciplinary follow-up program 3-6 and 24 months post-OHCA. Functional and neuropsychological outcomes were assessed through interviews, neurological exam, and validated neuropsychological testing.\nRESULTS: The total eligible cohort consisted of 49 paediatric OHCA survivors. The most common cause of OHCA was arrhythmia (33%). Median age at time of OHCA was 48 months, 67% were males. At 3-6 and 24 months post-OHCA, respectively 74 and 73% had a good PCPC score, defined as 1-2. Compared with normative data, OHCA children obtained worse sustained attention and processing speed scores 3-6 (n = 26) and 24 (n = 27) months post-OHCA. At 24 months, they also obtained worse intelligence, selective attention and cognitive flexibility scores. In children tested at both time-points (n = 19), no significant changes in neuropsychological outcomes were found over time. Intelligence scores did not correlate with PCPC.\nCONCLUSION: Although paediatric OHCA survivors had a good PCPC score 3-6 and 24 months post-OHCA, they obtained worse scores on important neuropsychological domains such as intelligence and executive functioning (attention and cognitive flexibility). Follow-up should continue over a longer life span in order to fully understand the long-term impact of OHCA in childhood.",

The Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) tool was designed to assess global functional level during ADL by investigating motor and process skills. The purpose of this study was to assess ADL performance ability by investigating motor and process skills in a consecutive cohort of adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at the time of discharge from hospital.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional study uses data from a prospective cohort of cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. The specific data used in this study were obtained at the time of the days or the day before hospital discharge. Adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to cardiac causes were eligible for inclusion. Assessment of Motor and Process Skills was used to assess ADL performance ability by investigating motor and process skills. The ADL ability of 61 individuals was assessed. The mean ADL ability measures recorded were AMPS process 1.40 logits (0.48) and AMPS motor 1.82 logits (0.40). Based on the dichotomized AMPS results, 23% were most likely to need assistance to live independently in the community.\nCONCLUSION: Performance ability during ADL revealed difficulty in the performance of process skill and an increased need for rehabilitation among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at the time of hospital discharge.",

Specifically, the focus was on identifying the different neurocognitive domains that are assessed, the measures used, and the level of, and criteria for, impairment.\nDESIGN AND REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from 2006 to 2021 was completed using Medline, Cinahl and Psychinfo. Criteria for inclusion were studies with participants over the age of 18, OHCA and at least one neurocognitive function measure. Qualitative and case studies were excluded. Reviewers assessed criteria and risk of bias using a modified version of Downs and Black.\nRESULTS: Forty-three studies were identified. Most studies had a low risk of bias (n = 31) or moderate risk of bias (n = 11) and one had a high risk; however, only six reported effect sizes or power analyses. Multiple measures of neurocognitive outcomes were used (>50) and level of impairment criteria varied considerably. Memory impairments were frequently found and were also more likely to be impaired followed by executive function and processing speed.\nDISCUSSION: This review highlights the heterogeneity of measures and approaches used to assess neurocognitive outcomes following OHCA as well as the need to improve risk of bias concerning generalizability. Improved understanding of the approaches used for assessment and the subsequent findings will facilitate a standardized evaluation of neurocognitive outcomes following OHCA.",

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following OHCA.\nMETHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to July 3, 2021, for studies reporting the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among OHCA survivors. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by two authors independently, and a third resolved discrepancies. A single-arm meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool the proportion of patients with these conditions at the earliest follow-up time point in each study and at predefined time points. Meta-regression was performed to identify significant moderators that contributed to between-study heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: The search yielded 15,366 articles. 13 articles were included for analysis, which comprised 186,160 patients. The pooled overall prevalence at the earliest time point of follow-up was 19.0% (11 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0-30.0%) for depression, 26.0% (nine studies; 95% CI = 16.0-39.0%) for anxiety, and 20.0% (three studies; 95% CI = 3.0-65.0%) for PTSD. Meta-regression showed that the age of patients and proportion of female sex were non-significant moderators.\nCONCLUSION: The burden of mental health disorders is high among survivors of OHCA. There is an urgent need to understand the predisposing risk factors and develop preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are 20,000 sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs) in Australia annually, with 90% case-fatality.\nOBJECTIVE: The present study calculated both the health and economic impact of SCAs in Victoria, Australia.\nMETHODS: Data on all SCAs attended by Ambulance Victoria from July 2017 to June 2018 were collected regarding age, gender, and survival to hospital, discharge and 12 months. Pre-SCA employment status of all patients was modelled using age and gender-matched Australian economic data. A Markov state-transition model with a five-year horizon calculated health and economic impact in years of life lived (YLL), productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) and gross domestic product (GDP) lost. A counterfactual Markov state-transition model assessed outcomes of an identical cohort of patients who did not experience SCA. All values were discounted by 5%.\nRESULTS: In 12 months, 4637 people suffered SCAs in Victoria, of whom 1516 (32.7%) were working at the time. 695 patients (15.0%) survived to hospital, 325 (7.0%) to discharge, and 303 (6.5%) to 12 months. In five years following their SCA, the cohort lost 15,922 years of life and 2327 PALYs. Reduced productivity led to GDP losses of AUD$448 million (92.8% relative reduction). Extrapolated to the 20,000 SCAs occurring across all of Australia, total GDP losses approached AUD$2 billion.\nCONCLUSION: The health and economic burden of SCAs is high, predominantly underpinned by very high mortality. Annual national losses approach AUD$2 billion (USD$1.42 billion) and are comparable to productivity losses from all cancers combined. Prioritising research and state-of-the-art care for SCA patients appears economically sound.",

We explored the psychological adjustment and experiential perspectives of survivors and families in the second year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: A prospective, mixed-methods study of adult OHCA survivors in Victoria, Australia was conducted. Eighteen survivors and 12 family members completed semi-structured interviews 14-19 months post-arrest. Survivors' cognition, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured using a battery of psychological assessments. A thematic content analysis approach was applied to qualitative interview data by two independent investigators, with data coded and categorised into themes and sub-themes.\nRESULTS: Survivors' cognition, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were not clinically elevated in the second year post-arrest. Subjective cognitive failures were associated with increased anxiety but not with mental state. Depression was significantly correlated with post-traumatic symptoms. Six primary themes emerged from survivors' recovery stories, focused on: awakening and realisation, barriers to adjustment, psychosocial difficulties, integration, protective factors and unmet needs. Family perspectives revealed four primary themes focused on trauma exposure, survivor adjustment problems, family impact, and areas for service improvement.\nCONCLUSION: Survivors and their family members describe complex recovery journeys characterised by a range of psychosocial adjustment challenges, which are not adequately captured by common psychological measures. Post-arrest care systems are perceived by survivors and their families as inadequate due to a lack of accurate information regarding post-arrest sequalae, limited follow-up and inconsistent access to allied health care.",

Arthur Frank's theory on illness narratives informed the analysis. Participant observation at two meetings for survivors and relatives regarding cardiac arrest was used for qualification of the interview guide.\nRESULTS: Five married couples participated. The mean age of the survivors and spouses was 70,4 and 71,4 years respectively, and time since OHCA varied from 12 to 66 months. Two themes of the dyadic experience emerged: 1) experiences during OHCA, and 2) experiences in life following OHCA. Subthemes differed with survivors emphasising a desire to return to the same life as before the OHCA, and the spouses narrating feelings of anxiety. Potential complications of the OHCA were often explained with reference to ageing processes, and the OHCA was contextualised in relation to previous life-changing events.\nCONCLUSION: In a long-term perspective, OHCA shapes the life trajectory of both the survivor and the spouse, and the relationship between them, underscoring a need for patient-centred care with a greater focus on the relationship of the dyads.",

Patients >80 years and those 18-80 years with OHCA from 4/2005-12/2010 were compared.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME: survival at four time points; secondary outcomes: neurological and functional status at hospital discharge, and relationship between survival, age and pre-arrest activities of daily living (ADL) and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scores (higher scores indicate worse function in both).\nRESULTS: 3,211 patients (1,259 >80 years, 1952 aged 18-80) with median follow-up 5.9 years (range 0.1-11.1 years) were included. Survival was better for younger patients at all four time points, including 7.8% versus 2.5% at hospital discharge, 4.6% versus 0.2% at late follow-up. Functional status at discharge was also better, 4.8 ± 5.4 versus 9.0 ± 4.7, p<0.001, and more young patients had CPC1/2, 60.7% versus 32.2%, p = 0.004. Older patients who survived to emergency department admission had increased mortality per year of age (2.6%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.026, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.006-1.048 versus 1.7%, HR 1.017, 95% CI 1.010-1.025), per point in pre-arrest ADL (3.0%, HR 1.030, 95% CI 1.007-1.054 versus 5.8%, HR 1.058, 95% CI 1.036-1.080), and per point in pre-arrest CPC (24%, HR 1.242, 95% CI 1.097-1.406 versus 37%, HR 1.370 95% CI 1.232-1.524).\nCONCLUSION: Patient independence before arrest may be a more crucial determinant of resuscitation outcome than older age alone. Discussion of end-of-life preferences is particularly important for older individuals with functional and cognitive decline.",

Given that many post-CA patients are lost to follow-up (LTFU), we explored whether these patients are systematically different from those who complete follow-up based on demographic, resuscitation and outcome characteristics.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 168 English-speaking CA survivors between 9/25/2016 and 5/31/2018. We measured demographic data and global functional outcomes using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) in-person at hospital discharge, and via telephone at 3-, 6-months, and 1-year. We compared patients LTFU (e.g., failure to contact or refused to follow-up) with those contacted. Patients who were hospitalized, in a rehabilitation facility, missed by the research team, or dead were considered not eligible for follow-up.\nRESULTS: Of the 116 patients eligible for follow-up at 3-months, the majority completed follow-up (n = 69; 59.5%) and 47 (40.5%) were LTFU. Conversely, at 6-months and 1-year, fewer subjects were assessed (42% and 47%) compared to those who were LTFU (58% and 53%), respectively. At 3-months, LTFU patients were younger, unmarried, and had longer ICU stay. At 6-months and 1-year, LTFU patients were primarily male, had a non-shockable primary rhythm, and non-cardiac arrest etiologies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of patients are LTFU during the first year after CA, and differences emerged for demographics and characteristics of the event. Future research should account for the informative, non-random distribution of patients LTFU.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment and psychopathology caused by brain hypoxia and the traumatic impact of critical illness are common in cardiac arrest survivors and can lead to negative consequences of everyday life functioning, and further impact mental health in relatives. Most studies have dealt with the mere survival rate after cardiac arrest and not with long-term consequences to mental health in cardiac arrest survivors. Importantly, we face a gap in our knowledge about suitable screening tools in the early post-arrest phase for long-term risk prediction of mental health problems. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel screening procedure to predict risk of disabling cognitive impairment and psychopathology 3 months after cardiac arrest. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate long-term prevalence of psychopathology in relatives.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSES: In this multicentre prospective cohort study, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors and their relatives will be recruited. The post-arrest screening includes the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI) and is conducted during hospitalisation. In a subsample of the patients, functional MRI is done, and cortisol determination collected. At 3-month follow-up, the primary study outcomes for 200 survivors include the Danish Affective Verbal Learning Test-26 (VAMT-26), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System tests (trail making, colour-word interference, word and design fluency), Rey's Complex Figure and Letter-number sequencing subtest of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, HADS and IES-R. For the relatives, they include HADS and IES-R.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the local regional Research Ethics Committee (H-18046155) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (RH-2017-325, j.no.05961) and follows the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and may impact the follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors.",

The aim of this study is therefore to describe and compare HRQoL in patients surviving OHCA and IHCA.\nMETHODS: Patients ≥18 years with Cerebral Performance Category 1-3 included in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2014 and 2017 were included. A telephone interview was performed based on a questionnaire sent 3-6 months post cardiac arrest, including EQ-5D-5L and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear- and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to describe and compare HRQoL in OHCA and IHCA survivors. Adjustments were made for sex, age and initial rhythm.\nRESULTS: In all, 1369 IHCA and 772 OHCA survivors were included. Most OHCA and IHCA survivors reported no symptoms of with anxiety (88% and 84%) or depression (87% and 85%). IHCA survivors reported significantly more problems in the health domains mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain/discomfort (p < 0.001 for all) and scored lower general health measured by EQ-VAS (median 70 vs. 80 respectively, p < 0.001) compared with the OHCA survivors.\nCONCLUSION: Survivors of IHCA reported significantly worse HRQoL compared to survivors of OHCA.

The primary outcome measure was Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at M18. Secondary outcome measures included evaluation at M18 of neurologic, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities; health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), anxiety and depression; and poor-outcome risk factors (GOS-E score ≤ 6).\nRESULTS: Among the 139 included patients, 98 were assessable for the primary outcome measure. At M18, 64 (65%) had full recovery or minor disabilities (GOS-E score > 6), 18 (18%) had moderate disabilities but were autonomous for daily-life activities (GOS-E score = 6), 12 (12%) had poor autonomy (GOS-E score < 6 but > 1), and four had died. Percentages of patients with GOS-E scores > 6 increased significantly over the 18-month study period. At M18, no patients had major neurologic disabilities, 20% had cognitive disabilities, 32% had anxiety symptoms, 25% had depression symptoms, and their HR-QOL was impaired compared with a sex- and age-matched population. Low-flow time, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at admission, coma duration > 3 days after cardiac arrest, and mechanical ventilation on days 3 and 7 were associated with poor functional outcome.\nINTERPRETATION: Among patients who awoke (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥12) in the 14 days following OHCA, 35% had moderate to severe disabilities or had died at M18. Interestingly, patients improved until M18 post-OHCA. Risk factors associated with poor functional outcome were low-flow time, clinical severity at ICU admission, prolonged coma duration, and mechanical ventilation.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT02292147; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.",

Survivors completed the Questionnaire for the Quality of Provider-Patient Interactions (QQPPI), Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). When completing the QQPPI and RHDS, survivors were asked to think back to their hospitalization and discharge. QoL domains (physical, psychological, social) were measured via the WHO-QOL BREF. Three multiple regression models examined associations between QQPPI, RHDS, and B-IPQ scores with QoL domains, adjusted for age, sex, months since arrest, self-reported understanding of cardiac arrest and potential post-arrest symptoms at discharge, self-reported memory at discharge, and functional status as defined by the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.\nRESULTS: A total of 163 survivors (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean time since arrest: 63.9 months) provided complete survey data. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.45, p ​< ​0.001) and lower readiness for discharge (β: 0.21, p ​= ​0.01) were associated with worse physical QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.47, p ​< ​0.001) was associated with worse psychological QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.28, p ​= ​0.001) and poor provider-patient communication (β: 0.35, p ​< ​0.001) were associated with worse social QoL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modifiable provider-patient relationship factors and illness perceptions were associated with quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest with good neurologic recovery.",

However, their experience of living and their health-related quality of life after such a life-changing event are quite variable, much more complex than just having lived or died, and should not be reduced to crude measures of neurological functioning.\nMETHODS: We conducted 32 in-depth qualitative interviews with survivor/family member dyads at various stages of survival. The interviews focused on the recovery journey, long-term issues most important to them and how measuring such concepts could help. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative thematic analysis techniques.\nRESULTS: During in-depth interviews with more than 30 survivors and caregivers we have heard that despite being a relatively high functioning group, their lives have been deeply affected by their cardiac arrest experience. They speak about the importance of both psychologic and physical recovery, the impact of return to work or changes in work identity and the necessity of support from family members in the recovery process. Spouses/family members also mentioned differences in perspective on their loved one's recovery and how they manage the fear of recurrence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work purposively brings a unique lens to the concept of cardiac arrest outcomes by placing priority on what is important to survivors and their families and what we may be missing in standard outcomes measures. There is a clear need for a more patient-centred outcome set for this population and our work indicates that psychologic assessment, return to work status and family input are key domains to be considered.",

Approximately 7 and 24 months after OHCA, survivors at selected study sites are invited to a standardized assessment, including performance-based tests of cognition and questionnaires of emotional problems, fatigue, executive function and insomnia. At 1:1 ratio, a matched control group from a cohort of acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients is recruited to perform the same assessment. We aim to include 100 patients per group. Potential differences between the OHCA patients and the MI controls at 7 and 24 months will be analyzed with a linear regression, using composite z-scores per cognitive domain (verbal, visual/constructive, working memory, episodic memory, processing speed, executive functions) as primary outcome measures. Results from OHCA survivors on the main TTM2-trial neurocognitive screening battery will be compared with neuropsychological test results at 7 months, using sensitivity and specificity analyses.\nDISCUSSION: In this study we collect detailed information on cognitive impairment after OHCA and compare this to a control group of patients with acute MI. The validation of the TTM2 neurocognitive screening battery could justify its inclusion in routine follow-up. Our results may have a potential to impact on the design of future follow-up strategies and interventions after OHCA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03543371 . Registered 1 June 2018.",

This paper presents the design and rationale of the TTM2-trial follow-up, where information on secondary and exploratory outcomes will be collected. We also present the explorative outcome analyses which will focus on neurocognitive function and societal participation in OHCA-survivors.\nMETHODS: Blinded outcome-assessors will perform follow-up at 30-days after the OHCA with a telephone interview, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). Face-to-face meetings will be performed at 6 and 24-months, and include reports on outcome from several sources of information: clinician-reported: mRS, GOSE; patient-reported: EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level responses version (EQ-5D-5L), Life satisfaction, Two Simple Questions; observer-reported: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA) and neurocognitive performance measures: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Exploratory analyses will be performed with an emphasis on brain injury in the survivors, where the two intervention groups will be compared for potential differences in neuro-cognitive function (MoCA, SDMT) and societal participation (GOSE). Strategies to increase inter-rater reliability and decrease missing data are described.\nDISCUSSION: The TTM2-trial follow-up is a pragmatic yet detailed pre-planned and standardised assessment of patient's outcome designed to ensure data-quality, decrease missing data and provide optimal conditions to investigate clinically relevant effects of TTM, including OHCA-survivors' neurocognitive function and societal participation.",

Data from six audiotaped focus group interviews were collected in either November 2018 or in March 2019. Analysis and interpretation of the transcribed texts was performed using a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach guided by Ricoeur for unfolding lived experiences.\nRESULTS: Three narratives were identified. The survivors narrated how they in the early phase after the cardiac arrest experienced: (a) 'a fragmented memory at the mercy of the system'. The analysis further showed how the participants were: (b) 'living in the shadow of anxiety and mixed feelings' and with the: (c) 'lost sense of self' up to several years after survival.\nCONCLUSION: The participants in our study experienced distinct bodily impairments, suffering, and the lost sense of self in the return to daily life from early on to several years after resuscitation. There seem to be an urgent need for an early initiated post-arrest transitional care program led by an expert cardiac arrest nurse. In particular, the healthcare professionals need to pay attention to survivors in employment and with children living at home. Facilitated cardiac arrest peer support groups might minimize the long-term suffering, heighten the self-image, and install a new hope for the future.\nIMPACT: To ease the post-arrest return to daily life for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors it seems important that a transitional care program from the inhospital setting to the community consist of: (a) screening for and education on bodily losses at an early stage, (b) provision of support on the often prolonged emotional reactions, and (c) referring for further individual and targeted psychological and neurological follow-up and rehabilitation if needed.",

Data was analysed using a phenomenographic approach.\nSETTING: The participants were nineteen Swedish registered nurses, experienced in cardiovascular care and providing follow-up care.\nFINDINGS: The nurses perceived the cognitive impairment of the survivors in qualitatively different ways, as illustrated in two categories: 'The perceptible and obvious' and 'The elusive and challenging'. The nurses perceived a variety of signs of cognitive impairment, emotional expressions related to these, and recovery from cognitive impairment. They perceived confidence in capturing cognitive function when they understood the signs of cognitive impairment as severe and obvious. However, it was perceived as difficult to assess cognitive function when impairments were subtle, resulting in uncertainty in terms of how to make assessments. Nurses made use of their own strategies for assessments, which were sometimes found to be inadequate when they understood that they had misinterpreted the survivors' cognitive impairment.\nCONCLUSION: Nurses feel uncertainty regarding detecting mild impairment in cardiac arrest survivors. By involving next of kin, nurses will gain a broader understanding of survivors' cognitive function.",

As such, there is an increasing need to explore long-term functional outcomes of survivors, such as return to work (RTW).\nMETHODOLOGY: We analysed baseline and 12-month follow-up data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry for patients that arrested between 2010 and 2016 who were working prior to their arrest. We also conducted more detailed RTW interviews in a subset of OHCA survivors who arrested between July and September 2017. Factors associated with RTW were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 884 previously working survivors were included in the analysis, 650 (73%) of whom RTW. Male sex (AOR 1.80; 95%CI: 1.10-2.94), arrests witnessed by emergency medical services (AOR 2.72; 95%CI: 1.50-9.25), discharge directly home from hospital (AOR 4.13; 95%CI: 2.38-7.18) and favourable 12-month health-related quality of life according to the EQ-5D were associated with RTW. Increasing age (AOR 0.97; 95%CI: 0.95-0.98), traumatic arrest aetiology (AOR 0.18; 95%CI: 0.04-0.77), and labour-intensive occupations (AOR 0.44; 95%CI: 0.29-0.66) were associated with decreased odds of RTW. Of the 23 OHCA survivors that participated in the more detailed RTW telephone-interview, 87% RTW. Flexible work hours or modified duties were offered to 74% of participants. Fatigue was the most frequently reported barrier to RTW.\nCONCLUSION: This is the largest study to collectively examine factors associated with RTW among survivors of OHCA. Although larger qualitative studies are needed, our findings highlight which patients are at risk of not RTW and who may benefit from targeted rehabilitation strategies.",

    "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: Advances in resuscitation science have resulted in a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. However, we know very little about the natural history of recovery and the unmet needs of survivors and their partners. This qualitative study sought to address this knowledge gap to improve understanding of the consequences of surviving cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken separately with survivors and their partners between 3 and 12-months following the cardiac arrest. An interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA) to data analysis was adopted. Developing themes were discussed between members of the research team.\nRESULTS: 8 survivors (41-79 years; 5 male; mean time 6.3 months post-hospital discharge) and 3 partners (1 male) were interviewed. The key (super-ordinate) theme of being 'trapped in a disrupted normality' was identified within the data. Five related subordinate themes included: existential impact, physical ramifications, emotional consequences, limiting participation in social activities and altered family roles.\nCONCLUSION: Recovery for survivors is hindered by a wide range of physical, emotional, cognitive, social and spiritual challenges that disrupt perceptions of 'normality'. Survivors and their carers may benefit from focussing on establishing a 'new normal' rather than striving to achieve a pre-cardiac social and physical position. Survivor-centred assessment should support rather than undermine this goal.",
