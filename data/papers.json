    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While there is a growing body of research in the field of post-cardiac arrest outcomes and survivorship, the lived experience of close family members who witness the arrest itself and who may have performed CPR, has not been specifically explored.\nMETHODS: We employed qualitative interpretive descriptive methodology using key informant interviews for data collection. Participants were recruited internationally, and interviews were conducted virtually following a semi-structured format. Thematic data analysis was conducted using a constant comparative approach.\nRESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 33 family members who were present at the time of their loved ones cardiac arrest. Across the participant stories, we identified the core concept of 'base trauma' that centres around what family member witnesses initially experience at the time of the arrest itself. We postulate that this core theme influences six significant patterns of experience including: 1) feelings of responsibility, 2) fear of recurrence without them, 3) the impact of reliving the event, 4) the inability to escape triggers, 5) the delayed realization of their own trauma, and lastly 6) dealing with psychologic disconnect.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is increasing research evidence that family members of cardiac arrest survivors have their own challenges as part of the recovery journey. We introduce novel concept of the compounded impact of the initial base trauma those that witness and respond to a loved ones cardiac arrest have. The nuanced experiences of this group point to the need to normalize their experience as a 'trauma' and suggest that support pathways need to recognize this.",

Interventions to prevent chronic distress post-CA are needed. We developed(RT-CA), an intervention to increase resiliency in CA survivor-caregiver dyads (pairs).\nMETHOD: We will conduct an open pilot clinical trial of RT-CA to examine preliminary feasibility and refine the intervention based on participant feedback. We will enroll at least 7 CA survivor-caregiver dyads during their hospitalization at a single academic medical center. We will identify eligible survivors by screening admission reports and through referrals from medical staff.: Survivors - sufficient cognitive status to meaningfully participate (Short Form of the Mini Mental State Exam ≥5). Dyads - English-speakers; one member must have clinically significant distress (≥8 on either Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale).dyads will participate in 6, 30-45 min sessions with a study clinician. Sessions will include mind-body coping skills training and provision of anticipatory guidance and resources to navigate CA-survivorship. Dyads will complete pre- and post-test measures of emotional distress and treatment targets. We will calculate frequencies and proportions of our primary outcomes (feasibility - recruitment, assessments, adherence, therapist fidelity and acceptability/credibility). After completing post-test assessments, dyads will provide feedback via exit interviews. We will integrate qualitative and quantitative data using explanatory-sequential mixed-methods.\nDISCUSSION: We will use our findings to refine RT-CA content and study procedures. If successful, RT-CA has potential to significantly improve quality of survivorship for CA survivors and their caregivers.",

This study aimed to explore through participatory and creative methods, children and young people's (CYP) experiences post-cardiac arrest intensive care. Participatory research includes drawing, painting and small-world play. CYPs were recruited who had been admitted to intensive care post-cardiac arrest and had the cognitive and physical ability to talk, draw, paint or play out their experiences. Seven CYPs and families consented to participate. The median number of interviews was two (IQR2,3), with a median interview length of 24 minutes (IQR15,65 minutes). Themes that emerged: gratitude, distrust and extrasensory experiences. Four of the seven (57%) participants opted to paint or draw to convey their experiences. Two (28%) participants had no memories of their cardiac arrest or time in intensive care but used creative methods to express gratitude to the care team. Participatory research methods may be an effective way for CYPs to convey their experiences of post-cardiac arrest intensive care. CYPs who have been critically ill have expressed a need to make sense of their experiences in intensive care. Healthcare professionals should be aware that these experiences may be deemed as extrasensory and require sensitive exploration.",

Therefore, the aim was to describe self-reported cognitive function and its association with health status, psychological distress, and life satisfaction.\nMETHODS: This study utilised data from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (2018-2021), registered 3-6 months post-CA. Cognitive function was assessed by a single question: \"How do you experience your memory, concentration, and/or planning abilities today compared to before the cardiac arrest?\". Health status was measured using the EQ VAS, psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and overall life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction checklist. Data were analysed using binary logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Among 4026 identified survivors, 1254 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.9 years (SD = 13.4) and 31.7% were female. Self-reported cognitive function among survivors was reported as: 'Much worse' by 3.1%, 'Worse' by 23.8%, 'Unchanged' by 68.3%, 'Better' by 3.3%, and 'Much better' by 1.5%. Declined cognitive function was associated with lower health status (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 2.09-3.64), symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.84, 95% CI = 2.80-5.24) and depression (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.22-6.32), and being dissatisfied with overall life (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.11-3.54). These associations remained significant after age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, initial rhythm, initial witnessed status, and cerebral performance were controlled.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survivors experiencing declined cognitive function post-CA are at a higher risk of poorer health status, increased psychological distress, and reduced life satisfaction, and these risks should be acknowledged by healthcare professionals.",

The aim was to describe the ADL ability among OHCA survivors at discharge from hospital, characteristics of OHCA survivors with decreased ADL ability, and changes in ADL ability over time.\nMETHODS: In this prospective cohort study, OHCA survivors were recruited and followed for 6 months. Observed ADL ability was evaluated prior to hospital discharge and at 6-month follow-up using the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), and self-reported ADL ability with the ADL Interview (ADL-I). Characteristics were compared between 2 groups: Participants with decreased observed ADL ability below age norms at hospital discharge and those meeting or exceeding age norms.\nRESULTS: Of the 156 OHCA survivors included, 125 completed the 6-month follow-up. At hospital discharge, 78% had observed ADL motor skills, and 47% ADL process skills below the competence thresholds. In total, 38% of the participants had an observed ADL ability below age norms. These participants were older and had lower cognitive scores at discharge compared to those meeting or exceeding the age norms. At hospital discharge, 89% reported decreased personal ADL ability, particularly in transferring, personal hygiene, body care, and dressing. Over 6 months, most participants improved in both their observed and self-reported ADL ability, although 11% still had an ability below age norm.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most OHCA survivors experienced decreased observed and self-reported ADL ability at hospital discharge and, despite improvement, decreased ADL ability persisted even after 6 months in some OHCA survivors.",

A subset of survivors underwent the clinician-rated Acute Stress Disorder Interview during hospitalization. Psychometric evaluation of the IES-R included reliability and validity testing. Structural validity was assessed using factor analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve were used to evaluate the discriminative ability of different IES-R thresholds in classifying probable Acute Stress Disorder, as determined by interview. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each cut-off value. The best performing IES-R threshold was applied to the total population to examine prevalence of probable Acute Stress Disorder.\nRESULTS: Overall, 244 survivors completed the IES-R, out of which 106 completed the Acute Stress Disorder Interview. Good internal consistency and convergent validity of the IES-R were observed. Factor analysis supported the original three-factor structure of the IES-R. An IES-R total cut-off score of ≥30 showed the best sensitivity-to-specificity ratio; the scale correctly classified 77% of the survivors with a sensitivity rate of 100% and a specificity rate of 75% (n = 106). Using this IES-R cut-off score, the prevalence of probable Acute Stress Disorder was 23% (n = 244).\nCONCLUSION: The IES-R appears to be a useful screening tool for Acute Stress Disorder during hospitalisation and helps clinicians make post-cardiac arrest diagnostic and treatment decisions.",

Although resuscitation advancements have increased survival, many survivors suffer cognitive impairments that affect their quality of life. Most research has focused on neurological outcomes, whereas little attention has been paid to cognitive function. The aim is to investigate the proportion of cognitive impairment in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest and to investigate the association between the duration of cardiac arrest and level of cognitive function.\nMETHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 184 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening tool. Duration of cardiac arrest was defined by no flow, low flow, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. Multiple logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) and CI.\nRESULTS: Of 184 survivors assessed, 26% had normal cognitive function at discharge, increasing to 67% at 6 months (n=149). Median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score improved from 23 (Q25-Q75: 20-26) to 26 (Q25-Q75: 24-28). At 6 months, adjusted ORs per minute were 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for low flow and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for time to return of spontaneous circulation, whereas associations at discharge were near null (aOR≈0.99). No significant association was found either at discharge or follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function improved considerably within 6 months following cardiac arrest, with the proportion of patients exhibiting normal cognitive function increasing from 26% to 67%. This study found no association between the duration of cardiac arrest and cognitive function.",

This study aimed to investigate the current practice in PCAC care across Italian paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), interviewing a cohort of pediatric intensivists.\nMETHODS: An electronic survey with 69 questions was distributed to 54 physicians from 23 PICUs in Italy. The survey covered various domains of PCAC care, including hemodynamics, oxygenation and ventilation, sedation, seizure and temperature control, infection treatment, glycemic control, transfusion practice, neuroprognostication, post-CA recovery and rehabilitation, organisation and local protocols.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight out of 54 invited physicians (51%) completed the survey, accounting for 82% of the participating PICUs. Up to 80% reported no specific PCAC protocol in their PICU. Half of the respondents suggested specific recommendations for patients of lower ages, particularly infants. Significant variability was observed in hemodynamic monitoring and support; 45% did not have a specific hemodynamic target, while 41% aimed for a systolic arterial pressure above the 50th age-specific percentile. Seventy-one percent lacked a protocol for target temperature management (TTM), with significant variability in practice. Sixty-four percent did not have a scheduled follow-up program for survivors after hospital discharge. A rehabilitation program for survivors and psychological support for patients and their families were available in half of the instances. Neuroprotective strategies, prognostication, and hemodynamic management were the top PCAC research priorities reported.\nCONCLUSION: The study revealed significant variability in PCAC care practices among pediatric intensivists. The majority of surveyed practitioners evidenced the limits of current PCAC evidence, potentially advocating the need for further research. The top three areas recognised as PCAC research priorities include hemodynamic optimisation, neuroprotective therapies and neuroprognostication.",

The second phase included developing a pen-and-paper neuropsychological screening battery, which proved too resource-intensive due to its reliance on neuropsychologists. Consequently, in the third phase, we transitioned to a tablet-based screening tool. The fourth phase involved proof of concept, assessing whether we had developed a feasible cognitive screening for cardiac arrest survivors that could be implemented in hospital departments and rehabilitation settings. For this procedure, we determined that the appropriate time for screening is six to eight weeks after hospital discharge, with screening results categorised as: 'no concerns,' 'need for further assessment,' and 'need for specialised rehabilitation. The screening, appropriate timing for its administration, and communication of results are presented.\nCONCLUSION: We have successfully developed and reported a digital screening for cognitive deficits following cardiac arrest. This approach has the potential to enable systematic screening of all cardiac arrest survivors.",

    "abstract": "Background Assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive screening are widely used in the care of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Evidence linking them to post-discharge outcomes is limited, but could support targeted rehabilitation efforts. Aim To assess whether ADL ability measures and cognitive screening at hospital discharge were associated with post-discharge ADL ability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and return to work. Methods This prospective cohort study included 200 OHCA survivors admitted to Aarhus University Hospital. Self-reported ADL ability was measured using the Activities of Daily Living Interview (ADL-I). Observed ADL ability was measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), dichotomised into age-matched or below-ability. Cognitive function was assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariable regressions, with multiple imputation, analysed associations between variables and outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Adjusted analyses showed significant associations between personal ADL-I (βadjusted = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2;0.5) and AMPS (βadjusted = -0.6, 95%CI:-1.2;-0.03) at discharge and self-reported ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest. Baseline AMPS was statistically significantly associated with age-matched ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest (ORadjusted 5.5, 95%CI: 1.5;10.0), and personal ADL-I (VAS: βadjusted = 3.00, 95%CI: 1.3;4.6/index score: βadjusted = 0.03, 95%CI 0.01;0.05) and MoCA (index: βadjusted = -0.09, 95%CI: -0.2;-0.02) with HRQoL. The association between MoCA and return to work one-year after cardiac arrest showed an OR of 3.0 (95%CI: 0.5;9.0), although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions Decreased ADL ability at hospital discharge was associated with poorer post-discharge outcomes in OHCA survivors, while cognitive screening was also associated with certain aspects of recovery.",

Applying the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), cognition and symptoms of psychopathology were assessed in survivors during hospitalisation. At three-month follow-up, we evaluated clinical symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using IES-R, and clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression with HADS in relatives. Logistic regression models were applied.\nRESULTS: At follow-up, 146 relatives (84% females) from 297 OHCA survivors participated. Median age was 55 years (IQR 21-79 years). Overall, relatives were found with clinical symptoms of PTSD (25%), anxiety (27%), and depression (14%). In unadjusted analysis, early cognitive impairment (MoCA score < 26) in survivors was associated with higher odds of clinical symptoms of PTSD in relatives (OR (95% CI) 2.61 (1.09-6.24, = 0.03) at three-months follow-up. This association was no longer significant after adjusting for age.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms of PTSD and anxiety were common in relatives of survivors at three months post-cardiac arrest. Further research is needed to identify factors that may be associated with mental health challenges in relatives to support these families early in the cardiac arrest survivorship.",

Early prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical measures predict long-term outcomes.\nMETHODS: In a longitudinal multicenter cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26).\nRESULTS: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive relation with twelve-month MoCA (β = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94).

As future healthcare providers, they must cultivate resilience while preserving empathy. Understanding their emotional responses during such critical events is essential to enhancing clinical education and developing effective psychological support systems.\nAIM: This study aimed to explore and describe the emotional experiences of nursing students who witnessed intraoperative cardiac arrest events, with the objective of informing educational and support strategies within high-stress clinical environments.\nMETHODS: A qualitative study using a descriptive phenomenological approach was conducted with fourteen final-year nursing students from Iran, purposively selected until data saturation. Participants had experienced at least one intraoperative cardiac arrest and were screened for mental well-being. Data were gathered through semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. Strategies to ensure trustworthiness included Lincoln and Guba's criteria-credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability-as well as bracketing, member-checking, and expert review.\nRESULTS: Seventy initial codes were extracted and organized into eleven sub-themes and four overarching themes: (1) Emotional Turmoil and Psychological Impact, (2) Professional Identity Formation, (3) Coping Mechanisms and Support Systems, and (4) Lessons for Clinical Practice.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative cardiac arrest elicits intense emotional reactions and identity-related struggles among nursing students. Incorporating structured debriefing, high-fidelity simulation with emotional components, and mentorship into clinical training could help transform these distressing experiences into valuable opportunities for resilience-building. Such interventions are critical for supporting students' emotional development and improving the quality of patient care.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) might can lead to long-term consequences, including fatigue, reduced quality of life, and mental health challenges. Although these factors impact daily activities, the influence of fatigue across specific age groups is currently unknown. Purpose The objective of this study was to describe the proportion and severity of fatigue, and to investigate the association between age groups (18-64 and +65 years) and fatigue, adjusted for socio-demographic-, clinical-, and self-reported outcomes. Methods This study is based on data from a national cross-sectional survey, the DANish Cardiac Survivorship (DANCAS) survey. OHCA survivors aged ≥18 years and alive at 30 days post-OHCA were included. In the current study, the following self-reported outcome measures were included: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MFIS (measuring fatigue), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS (measuring symptoms of anxiety, HADS-A and depression HADS-D), WHO Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS 2.0 (measuring disability). Descriptive statistics were used to describe socio-demographic-, clinical- and self-reported outcomes across the two age groups. A simple (unadjusted) and two adjusted linear regression models (Model 1, adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, Model 2 further adjusted for HADS-A, HADS-D and WHODAS) were used to investigate the association between age groups and fatigue, reported as regression coefficients β and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results In total, n=1236 responding survivors were included in the study, with a median age of 67 years (interquartile range, IQR 57-74) divided into the two age groups: 18-64 years n=551, 65+ years n=685. Across the population, 81% were men. Younger survivors reported significantly higher (worse) levels of fatigue (median 19 IQR 6-38) compared to older survivors (median 13 IQR 5-28), in addition to worse scores on HADS-A, HADS-D and WHODAS 2.0. The regression analyses revealed that being in the younger age group was significantly associated with an increase in fatigue scores in both adjusted models (Model 1 β 4.80 95% CI 2.63;6.98, Model 2 β 1.57 95% CI 0.22;2.92), Table 1. Conclusion Younger OHCA survivors reported statistically significantly worse levels of fatigue compared to older survivors, along with worse self-reported anxiety, depression and disability. Younger age was significantly associated with fatigue in adjusted models, although the inclusion of self-reported outcome measures reduced the strength of the association, highlighting their influence on fatigue. These findings demonstrate the importance of addressing age-specific challenges in rehabilitation- and support programs, in addition to emphasizing that fatigue following OHCA is a complexconcept influenced by multiple psychosocial and clinical factors.Table 1",

    "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurs when the heart pauses to function outside of a medical facility. The high mortality rate persists despite advancements in resuscitation research, rendering it a significant global public health issue. To substantially reduce mortality associated with OHCA, a comprehensive understanding of all management phases—pre-hospital, in-hospital, and post-discharge—is essential. Pre-hospital factors, such as community socioeconomic level, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and access to defibrillators, are essential for early survival. In-hospital variables, like the accessibility of round-the-clock cardiac interventional treatments and structured emergency reception systems, can affect outcomes. Post-discharge survival mostly depends on patient adherence to medical and lifestyle interventions, psychological support, and rehabilitation programs. This assessment consolidates information about the factors influencing the management of OHCA and identifies critical issues and opportunities within the Jordanian healthcare system.",

OHCA survivors from participating sites were contacted 5-8 years post OHCA. Survival rates were collected from medical registries. Telephone interviews were performed to collect basic outcomes and quality of life. Questionnaires surveyed patients and relatives levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep, fatigue, cognitive decline and everyday life participation.\nRESULTS: 279 patients were included at the participating sites, 161 (58%) were still alive. A vast majority of the participating survivors (97.8%) had favourable outcomes (CPC 1-2) and quality of life was comparable to the background population. Among the participating OHCA survivors, 5.5% met the criteria for anxiety, 2.7% for depression, 4.5% for PTSD, 24.5% reported sleep problems, 45.5% reported fatigue, and 40.7% were working full- or part-time. Among the participating relatives, 7.0% met the criteria for anxiety, 1.2% for depression, 3.5% for PTSD, and 52.3% of the relatives reported that the patient had suffered cognitive decline post OHCA. ROSC delay, higher age, and female sex were negatively associated with several long-term outcomes. Treatment allocation was not associated with better outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term OHCA survivors had acceptable outcomes, though self-reported sleep and fatigue problems and relatives-reported cognitive decline were prevalent. Higher age and longer ROSC delay were risk factors of poorer outcome, primarily driven by mortality. Female sex was a risk factor of worse self-reported outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01689077.",

    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate long-term functional outcomes following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA).\nMETHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro were searched to 14 February 2025. Eligible studies included adults (≥18 years) who received conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation for IHCA and reported neurological, cognitive, psychological, or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes at ≥ 3 months post-IHCA. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Meta-analyses of binary outcomes were performed using random-intercept logistic regression. Narrative synthesis was used where pooling of results was not feasible. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251009496).\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine studies from 21 countries were included (sample size n = 16-1539 patients). Most were moderate to high risk of bias. Across the full cohort, the pooled proportion of poor neurological outcome was 78.9% (95% CI 73.5-83.4%; I = 95.6%). Among survivors, 9.9% (95% CI 5.8-16.3%; I86.4%) had poor neurological outcome, with lower proportions at longer follow-up. Clinically significant anxiety and depression affected 13.1% (95% CI 6.1-26.0%; I = 92.3%) and 8.1% (95% CI 4.6-13.7%; I = 75.7%) of survivors, respectively. HRQoL impairments were frequently reported, particularly in pain/discomfort (60.5% [95% CI 57.9-63.0%; I = 37.6%]), usual activities (52.6% [95% CI 50.0-55.2%; I = 0.0%]), and anxiety/depression (49.0% [95% CI 46.4-51.6%; I = 0.0%]). Cognitive impairments were reported in one study. Substantial statistical heterogeneity (I > 75%) was observed across most analyses. Wide variation in outcome measures, follow-up duration, and reporting methods limited synthesis.\nCONCLUSION: While many IHCA survivors achieve favourable long-term outcomes, a significant proportion experience persistent impairments. Greater standardisation in outcome measurement and reporting is needed to improve comparability across studies and guide post-arrest care.",

All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12-month EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS).\nRESULTS: There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data. The ECPR cohort was younger [mean(SD) 50.4(13.46) vs 60.5(14.01) yrs, p < 0.01] and more likely to have received bystander CPR [19(79%) ECPR vs 397(52%) CCPR, p < 0.001]. Both cohorts had similar proportions of males, witnessed arrests and initial shockable rhythms. Median (IQR) arrest to ROSC/ECMO time was longer in ECPR than CCPR [61(41.5-97) vs 6(2-14) minutes, p < 0.001]. The median (IQR) EQ-5D-5L utility score [0.95 (0.72-1) ECPR vs 0.96 (0.86-1) CCPR, p = 0.64] and median (IQR) EQ-VAS at 12 months [80 (64.5-90) ECPR vs 75 (60-85) CCPR, p = 0.39] were similar. There were no significant differences in the EQ-5D-5L utility scores and EQ-VAS even after adjustment for baseline imbalances.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite significant baseline differences between ECPR and CCPR, there were no differences in HRQoL at 12 months.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The international multi-center randomized controlled STEPCARE-trial will investigate optimal management of sedation, temperature, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during intensive care in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients due to various etiologies. The primary outcome is mortality at 6 months. This protocol describes an extended follow-up sub-study of the STEPCARE-trial with the main objective to provide detailed long-term outcomes for survivors and caregivers. It will focus on potential neuroprotection and improved recovery for different targets of sedation, temperature, and MAP management at 6 and 12 months post-OHCA.\nMETHODS: All survivors and one caregiver per survivor at selected STEPCARE sites will be invited to participate. Randomization is stratified by site. This sub-study extends the main STEPCARE follow-up at 6 months by undertaking detailed assessments, face-to-face meetings, inclusion of a caregiver, and repeating the assessments at 12 months. Our main outcome for survivors is cognitive function measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and for caregivers, the caregiver burden measured by the Zarit Burden Interview. Additional outcomes include symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fatigue, physical function, life satisfaction, and life impact (disability), assessed by psychometrically robust measures. The estimated sample size is 600. Efforts to improve interrater reliability and decrease missing data are integral to the study design.\nCONCLUSION: These detailed long-term outcomes will explore the possible benefits or risks of fever, sedation, and blood pressure management in post-OHCA survivors. Additionally, this study will explore survivorship after cardiac arrest from various perspectives, including different causes of arrest.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT0207942.",

Quality of life was then compared with reference values (patients with cardiovascular diseases, patients with ischemic heart disease, ICU-survivor patients at 36 months after discharge, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with V-A ECMO).\nRESULTS: Among 45 survivors, 25 patients completed the SF-36 form with a mean time for assessing quality of life of 6.9 ± 2.3 years. Sub-scores were globally comparable with those observed in referent cohorts.\nDISCUSSION: Cardiac arrest marks the beginning of a medical journey that includes intensive care management and the onset of cardiac disease, often of ischemic origin. Our data suggest that quality of life of patients treated with V-A ECMO for cardiac arrest is comparable to those reported in referent cohorts (ICU-survivors, patients with cardiovascular diseases of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac arrest survivors not treated with mechanical circulatory support).\nCONCLUSION: Survivor patients who experienced cardiac arrest and treated with V-A ECMO presented a good long-term quality of life. Decision regarding V-A ECMO implantation should not be limited by concerns about patients' future quality of life.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors often face significant health challenges, including insomnia, which can adversely affect their health-related quality of life. The Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) is a brief, self-reported instrument designed to screen for insomnia. This study aimed to identify the measurement properties of the MISS in CA survivors and to explore a relevant cut-off score.\nMETHODS: Data were collected from two studies: a health survey of CA survivors and a sub-study of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on targeted temperature management (TTM2). A total of 269 CA survivors participated, with 212 from the survey and 57 from the RCT, the data was collected 6-7 months after CA. The MISS was evaluated using the polytomous Rasch model, focusing on model fit, local independence, response category functioning, targeting, reliability, and differential item functioning (DIF).\nRESULTS: In total, 212 participants were males and 57 females, with a mean age of 66 years. Overall, 51% had survived in-hospital CA and 49% out-of-hospital CA. The MISS exhibited acceptable model fit and targeting, with no disordered thresholds or DIF for age, sex, or place of arrest. The reliability was acceptable. The suggested optimal cut-off score for identifying insomnia was ≥6 points.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that MISS is a valid and reliable screening instrument for insomnia in CA survivors. These results support the use of MISS for screening insomnia in CA survivors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is an emergency with historically low survival rates. Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers.\nOBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being.\nMETHODS: The Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants aged ≥18 years and caregivers aged ≥21 years will be recruited from all public hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, and Zarit Burden Interview.\nDISCUSSION: This study allows us to understand the natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA sequelae.",

The aims were to determine 1) the prevalence of PTG, and 2) the influence of survivor characteristics during hospitalization on levels of PTG at follow-up in a Danish cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors.\nMETHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study including OHCA survivors, exploring soci-odemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics using the Montreal Cognitive Assess-ment (MoCA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Crisis Support Scale (CSS) during hospitalization. At three-month follow-up, structured interviews were conducted to assess PTG at personal, relational, and institutional levels. The influence of survivor characteristics on PTG was explored using Pearson's chi-square tests.\nRESULTS: Overall, 173 survivors were included. At follow-up, 87% of survivors reported hav-ing one or more levels of PTG. The analysis revealed that the absence of cognitive impairment (MoCA ≥ 26 vs. MoCA < 26) was associated with personal growth ( = 0.02), being younger (<58 years vs. ≥ 58 years) with relational growth ( = 0.03) and being female or having symp-toms of depression (HADS ≥ 8 vs. HADS < 8), with institutional growth ( = 0.02 and = 0.04), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The OHCA survivors reported high levels of PTG at three-month follow-up. The type of PTG level was influenced by the absence of cognitive impairment, younger age, fe-male sex, and symptoms of depression during hospitalisation. Social support, symptoms of anxiety, and traumatic distress did not significantly influence the level of PTG.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Smartphone alerting systems designed to dispatch volunteer first responders to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases are progressing rapidly. Recently, growing attention has been given to understanding the impact of these operations on first responders, with a particular focus on safeguarding them from possible psychological challenges. This study investigates the psychological stress experienced by first responders following their involvement in an operation, analyzing specific stress factors to enhance opportunities for psychological support.\nMETHODS: two-stage questionnaire (Q1 and Q2) survey was conducted, with surveys administered one and four weeks after dispatched first responder arrived at the scene between October 9, 2023, and January 23, 2024. Screening questions based on the FAUST study assessed psychological stress, with ≥4 positive responses indicating at-risk individuals. Personal and operational variables were analyzed for their correlation with stress levels for identifying affected first responder. The study was approved by the Freiburg Ethics Committee (DRKS00032958).\nRESULTS: The response rates for the triggered questionnaires were 190/324 (59%) for Q1 and 132/322 (41%) for Q2. Fewer than 1% answered ≥4 screening questions positively, indicating a low measured prevalence of psychological stress. Situations involving resuscitation or already deceased patients but also first responders' feelings of insecurity were identified as significant factors of possible psychological stress, while regular CPR training appeared to significantly reduce the likelihood of stress.\nCONCLUSIONS: First responders who volunteer for such roles frequently encounter challenging situations. However, psychological stress is rarely reported. Integrating mechanisms into smartphone alerting systems to identify stress indicators and provide accessible support is essential.",

    "abstract": "This psychometric study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) following a cardiac event, and to examine the relationship between self- and informant-ratings. Approximately 7 months post-cardiac event, 196 participants and their informants ( = 179) completed the DEX. Reliability was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis and internal consistency estimates. Construct validity was evaluated using two performance-based neuropsychological tests, the Colour-Word Interference Test and the Trail Making Test (TMT), along with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A one-factor model showed acceptable fit for the self-assessed DEX (RMSEA = 0.062) with excellent internal consistency ( > 0.90). Slight positive associations were found between the DEX and the performance-based executive function measures, while strong positive associations emerged between the self-assessed DEX and the HADS. Overall, self-assessed and informant-reported scores did not differ significantly (self-assessed DEX median = 11,- = 5.75-20; informant-reported DEX median = 11,- = 4-19, = 0.924). However, participants with severe executive dysfunction (TMT-B-scores ≤-2) rated their own symptoms as less severe than informants ( = .001), indicating impaired self-awareness in a subgroup of participants. In conclusion, the DEX provides a useful perspective into general executive dysfunction in daily life but should be complemented with performance-based measures.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03543371.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Sex differences in survival and short-term outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are well documented, but its impact on long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unclear.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess HRQoL among adult OHCA survivors in Denmark between 2001 and 2019 who were alive as of 1 October 2020. Survivors were grouped by time since cardiac arrest: 0-4, >4-8, >8-12, and >12 years post-arrest. Among 2552 respondents (56.1% response rate), 2075 were men (81.3%) and 477 were women (18.7%). The mean survey age was 60.2 years (SD 14.7) for women and 66.0 years (SD 11.8) for men. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale and EuroQol Health Questionnaire index scores were both lower for women than for men [69 vs. 75 and 0.76 (SD 0.21) vs. 0.84 (SD 0.17), respectively; P < 0.001]. The SF-12 physical and mental health scores were also lower for women [40.3 (SD 12.9) and 50.9 (SD 8.8)] compared with men [44.0 (SD 12.1) and 53.3 (SD 8.1); P < 0.001]. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores for anxiety (5.4 vs. 3.5; P < 0.001) and for depression (4.0 vs. 3.2; P < 0.001) were higher among women. In multivariable logistic regression, female sex remained significantly associated with poorer long-term HRQoL outcomes. Trends remained consistent regardless of time since cardiac arrest.\nCONCLUSION: Female OHCA survivors reported less favourable long-term HRQoL outcomes compared with male survivors, irrespective of time elapsed since cardiac arrest.",

To address this, we adapted a resilience intervention for survivors and their caregivers, entitled Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest (RT-CA).\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of RT-CA between 09/2024-03/2025. We enrolled dyads of consecutively admitted CA survivors at Massachusetts General Hospital and their primary family caregivers.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: adult English speakers, survivors must have ability to meaningfully participate (Short Form Mini Mental State Exam ≥5), one dyad member must have emotional distress (≥8 on either subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]).\nPROCEDURE: Dyads participated in six weekly sessions with a clinical psychologist focused on building mindfulness and coping skills. Feasibility outcomes were feasibility of recruitment, assessments, adherence; acceptability outcomes were satisfaction, credibility, expectancy. Dyads completed pre- and post-test psychosocial measures and participated in exit interviews. We calculated frequencies and proportions of our outcomes, conducted exploratory paired t-tests to examine initial signals of changes in psychosocial measures, and performed explanatory-sequential mixed methods to integrate data sources.\nRESULTS: We screened 12 dyads and enrolled 7. RT-CA exceeded most feasibility and acceptability benchmarks (>70 % on 7 of 8). In exploratory analyses, participants experienced preliminary, yet meaningful reductions in emotional distress (HADS anxiety survivors: mean [95 % CI] = -5.4 [-3.4, -7.5], p < 0.001; depression survivors = -5.1 [-2.2, -8], p < 0.01; anxiety caregivers = -3.1 [-0.8, -5.5], p < 0.05; depression caregivers = -3.5 [-8, 1.1], p > 0.05). Mixed-methods analysis indicated general concordance between quantitative and qualitative data.\nCONCLUSION: Results support preliminary feasibility of RT-CA. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial is now required.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT06517394.",

However, no definitive data are available on this topic, so this study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional screening system for OHCA survivors in Italy and the prevalence of these disorders.: OHCA survivors discharged with good neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ≤ 2 and modified Ranking Scale (mRS) ≤ 3) from hospitals in the \"Lombardia CARe\" registry will be evaluated by a clinical psychologist using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) at pre-discharge or within 15 days and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients with clinical issues will be referred for psychological support or to a community rehabilitation program. Feasibility will be defined as a recruitment rate ≥ 80% and acceptability as a retention rate ≥ 50% over 12 months.: Based on historical data from the Lombardia CARe, an estimated 350 eligible survivors are expected, which will allow estimation of a prevalence ranging between 20% and 30% with 5% precision and 95% confidence.: This study will be the first in Italy to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional system for pre-/post-discharge evaluation of cognitive impairment, mental health, and quality of life in a large cohort of OHCA survivors, documenting the prevalence of these disorders.",

While in-hospital, OHCA survivors were screened for cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and traumatic distress using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised. At three-month follow-up, fatigue severity was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS ≥ 4 indicates clinically important fatigue. Logistic regression models were applied.\nRESULTS: Overall, 173 survivors were included (mean age 63.1 ± 11.7 years). At follow-up, the median FSS score was 3.2 points (IQR 2-9) and 42 % of survivors presented with clinically important fatigue (FSS ≥ 4). Those with fatigue were more often female, had longer hospital stays, reported greater in-hospital symptoms of anxiety, depression and traumatic distress, poorer sleep quality and health-related quality of life at follow-up. In the multivariable regression model, including age, sex, length of stay, anxiety, depression, traumatic distress and sleep quality, only traumatic distress was independently associated with FSS ≥ 4 (OR 4.6, 95 % CI: 1.5-14.7, p = 0.009).\nCONCLUSION: More than a third of OHCA survivors self-reported fatigue at three-month follow-up. In-hospital symptoms of traumatic distress were associated with higher odds of fatigue. While these findings underscore the potential value of early identification of traumatic distress, further research is needed to evaluate the benefits of screening and to identify interventions to support recovery after cardiac arrest.",

Identified research gaps include a lack of knowledge around what type of intervention is needed to best navigate recovery. In this study, we investigate the feasibility and patient acceptability of a new virtual psychoeducational group intervention for OHCA survivors and their relatives and compare it to a control group receiving a digital information booklet.V-CARE is a comparative, single-blind randomized pilot trial including participants at selected sites of the STEPCARE trial, in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Inclusion criteria are a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3 at 30-day follow-up; no diagnosis of dementia; and not experiencing an acute psychiatric episode. One caregiver per patient is invited to participate optionally. The intervention group in V-CARE receives four semi-structured, one-hour-long, psychoeducational sessions delivered remotely via video call by a trained clinician once a week, 2-3 months after hospital discharge. The sessions cover understanding cardiac arrest; coping with fatigue and memory problems; managing low mood and anxiety; and returning to daily life. The control group receives an information booklet focused on fatigue, memory/cognitive problems, mental health, and practical coping strategies.Primary: feasibility (number of patients consented) and acceptability (retention rate); secondary: satisfaction with care (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 item), self-management skills (Self-Management Assessment Scale) and, where available, health-related outcomes assessed in the STEPCARE Extended Follow-up sub-study including cognition, fatigue, mood, quality of life, and return to work.If preliminary insights from the V-CARE trial suggest the intervention to be feasible and acceptable, the results will be used to design a larger trial aimed at informing future interventions to support OHCA recovery.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of volunteer responders attending a paediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (POHCAs) in Denmark.\nDESIGN: This qualitative study used the Reflective Lifeworld Research theoretical framework. Data were generated through nine in-depth, in-person or virtual semistructured interviews conducted with volunteer responders.\nSETTING: The study was conducted in Denmark. We recruited volunteer responders from all of Denmark enrolled in the nationwide volunteer responder programme.\nPARTICIPANTS: Nine volunteer responders who were dispatched in response to a POHCA from 2020 to 2023 were included in the study.\nRESULTS: The experiences of attending a POHCA were categorised into three key themes: the mission, the situation and the aftermath. The mission refers to the altruistic drive of volunteer responders to contribute to life-saving efforts. The situation reflects the profound shock experienced when volunteer responders realise that the patient is a child, alongside their ability to act decisively and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the situation. The aftermath reveals the deep sense of fulfilment derived from being present and actively involved in attempting to save a child's life, as well as the various emotions and reactions that the volunteer responders process after the event.\nCONCLUSION: Attending a POHCA is a profoundly intense experience that can leave an emotional impact on the volunteer responders. On arriving at the location, despite the initial shock upon realising that the patient is a child, the volunteer responders engage in the resuscitation attempt and offer support to the child's family. However, alerting the volunteer responders beforehand that the patient is a child may help mitigate the initial shock. Volunteer responders find significant meaning in their roles and express a strong commitment to saving lives, irrespective of the age of those in need.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent medical care and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given that in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still poorly investigated, data on health-associated quality of life thereafter remains scarce. The available evidence is mostly transferred from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest studies, but the epidemiology and determinants of success might be different. The aim of the study was to investigate the change in the quality of life after in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify potential risk factors for a poor outcome.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis of data and prospective evaluation of quality of life included all patients surviving an IHCA and being treated by the emergency medical team between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint of the study was the quality of life after IHCA at the reference date. Secondary endpoints covered determination of risk factors and predictors of poor outcome after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nRESULTS: In total 604 patients were resuscitated within the period of 11 years and 61 (10%) patients survived until the interview took place. Finally, 48 (79%) patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 31 (65%) were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the quality of life before and after cardiac arrest (EQ-5D-5L utility 0.79 vs. 0.78, p = 0.567) and in the EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) score.\nCONCLUSION: The quality of life before and after IHCA in survivors was good and comparable. The quality of life was mostly affected by reduced mobility and anxiety/depression. Future studies with larger patient samples should focus on potentially modifiable factors that could prevent, warn, and limit the consequences of in-hospital cardiac arrest. Moreover, research on outcomes of IHCA should include available tools for the quality of life assessment.",

However, knowledge on its association with self-reported health in CA survivors is still incomplete.\nAIM: To examine the associations between initial rhythm and self-reported health in CA survivors.\nMETHODS: This nationwide study used data from the Swedish Register for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 3-6 months post CA. Health status was measured using EQ-5D-5L and psychological distress by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences in self-reported health between groups of different initial rhythms. To control for potential confounders, age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, witnessed status, time to CPR, time to defibrillation, and neurological function were included as covariates in multiple regression analyses for continuous and categorical outcomes.\nRESULTS: The study included 1783 adult CA survivors. Overall, the CA survivors reported good health status and symptoms of anxiety or depression were uncommon (13.7% and 13.9% respectively). Survivors with PEA and asystole reported significantly more problems in all dimensions of health status (p = 0.037 to p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.034), and depression (p = 0.017) compared to VT/VF. Overall, these differences did not remain in the adjusted regression analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Initial rhythm is not associated with self-reported health when potential confounders are controlled. Initial rhythm seems to be an indicator of unfavourable factors causing the arrest, or factors related to characteristics and treatment. Therefore, initial rhythm may be used as a proxy for identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes such as worse health status and psychological distress.",

Nevertheless, the relationship between PICS-relevant domains in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and psychological distress in their family members (henceforth, PICS-F) remains underexplored.: We enrolled consecutive CA patients admitted between 16 August 2021 and 28 June 2023 to an academic medical center, along with their close family members, in prospective studies. Survivors' PICS domains were: physical dependence (Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, PSMS), cognitive impairments (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-M), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS) symptoms (PTSD Checklist-PCL 5), as well as PICS-F (PCL-5 Total Score). Hierarchical multivariate linear regressions examined associations between PICS-F and survivors' PICS domains.: Of 74 dyads (= 148), survivors had a mean () age of 56 ± 16 years, with 61% being male and with a median hospital stay of 28 days. Family members (43% spouses) were slightly younger (52 ± 14 years), predominantly female (72%), and of minority race/ethnicity (62%). A high prevalence of PICS assessed 28.5 days (interquartile range 10-63) post-CA was observed in survivors (78% physical dependence, 54% cognitive impairment, 30% PTSS) and in family members (30% PTSS). Survivor PTSS was significantly associated with family member distress (= 0.3,= 0.02), independent of physical dependence (= 0.0,= 0.9), cognitive impairment (= -0.1,= 0.5), family member characteristics, and duration of hospitalization.: Both CA survivors and their family members showed substantial evidence of likely PICS. Survivor PTSS is notably associated with family member distress, highlighting the need for dyadic interventions to enhance psychosocial outcomes.",

Thus, the objectives were to i) describe differences in self-reported mental well-being, mental health, and caregiver strain at different time points (1-5 years) post-OHCA and ii) investigate characteristics associated with caregiver strain.\nMETHODS: A national cross-sectional survey (DANCAS) from October 2020 to March 2021 with OHCA survivors and their closest relatives. The relative survey included the WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (M-CSI). Differences in scores between time groups were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between characteristics and caregiver strain were investigated with multivariable logistic regression models, presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for gender, age, education status, relative affiliation, and time after OHCA.\nRESULTS: Of 561 relatives, 24% (n = 137) experienced caregiver strain, with no significant differences in the relatives' mental well-being, mental health, or caregiver strain with time since OHCA. In the adjusted analyses, older age (OR 0.98 95% CI 0.96;0.99) and several self-reported outcomes, including reduced mental well-being (WHO-5 OR 7.27 95% CI 4.86;11.52), symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A OR 6.01 95% CI 3.89;9.29) and depression (HADS-D OR 15.03 95% CI 7.33;30.80) were significantly associated with worse caregiver strain.\nCONCLUSION: Nearly one-quarter of relatives of OHCA survivors experience caregiver strain, with this proportion remaining unchanged with time. Several outcomes were associated with caregiver strain, emphasising the need to identify relatives at greater risk of burden following OHCA.",

These instruments were administered at 6-months in the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM2) trial. We used a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery from a TTM2 trial sub-study as a gold standard to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the neurocognitive screening.\nRESULTS: In our cohort of 108 OHCA survivors (median age = 62, 88% male), the most favourable cut-off scores were: MoCA < 26; SDMT z ≤ -1; IQCODE-CA ≥ 3.04. The MoCA (sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.85) and SDMT (sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.83) had a higher classification accuracy than the TSQ (sensitivity 0.28, specificity 0.74) and IQCODE-CA (sensitivity 0.42, specificity 0.60). When using the cut-points for MoCA or SDMT in combination to identify neurocognitive impairment, sensitivity improved (0.81, specificity 0.74), area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI [0.69, 0.85]. The most common unidentified impairments were within the episodic memory and executive functions domains, with fewer false negative cases on the MoCA or SDMT combined.\nCONCLUSION: The MoCA and SDMT have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for screening for neurocognitive impairment in an OHCA population, and when used in combination the sensitivity improves. Patient and observer-reports correspond poorly with neurocognitive performance.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov Identifier: NCT03543371.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background It is well known that out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors, as well as their relatives, struggle with symptoms of anxiety and depression, but less is known about the potential differences in paired outcomes. Purpose To describe differences in symptoms of anxiety and depression among OHCA survivors and their relatives (paired) and to investigate characteristics associated with these symptoms among both groups. Methods A national cross-sectional survey (DANCAS) was conducted with OHCA survivors combined with a survey for their closest relatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was included in both surveys. Paired t-tests were used to examine potential differences in HADS mean scores among survivors and relatives. Associations between characteristics (demographic and other self-reported outcomes) and symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A ≥8) and depression (HADS-D ≥8) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models, presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for potential confounders. Results In total, 526 pairs of OHCA survivors and their relatives both responded, with 447 (85%) of the survivors being men, a median age of 67 years (IQR 59-75) and 462 (88%) of the relatives being women with a median age of 64 years (IQR 55-70). Most relatives (85%) were spouses or unmarried partners. In the paired analyses, relatives had significantly higher scores of anxiety compared to survivors (mean 5.6 SD 4.0 vs 3.5 SD 3.8; p<0.001). On the contrary, survivors had significantly worse scores of depression (mean 3.1 SD 2.8 vs 2.4 SD 3.2; p>0.001). Several characteristics (demographic and self-reported) were associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression among both survivors and relatives, Table 1 & 2. Conclusion Following OHCA, relatives report worse scores of anxiety while, in contrast, survivors report worse scores of depression, indicating psychological interventions should be tailored differently for the two groups. Further investigation of the reasons for these findings are needed, including whether fatigue might be a symptom of depression or a confounder.",

We quantified emotional distress using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge.\nRESULTS: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard deviation ± 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted β's [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems should consider implementing routine in-hospital screening for emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence for CA survivors who are awake, alert and approaching hospital discharge, and prioritize brief in hospital treatment or post-discharge referrals.",

Survivors often suffer from cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression, that affect significantly their quality of life. Current post-discharge care is inconsistent and frequently overlooks subtle but disabling symptoms. The ENFORCER trial aims to significantly enhance the health and quality of life of OHCA survivors by providing a comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly internet-based lifestyle intervention.\nMETHODS: ENFORCER is a multicentre, parallel group randomized controlled trial involving OHCA survivors aged 18-80 years with cognitive impairment or anxiety/depression measured through validated instruments.Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or the control group. The intervention group will receive a one-year program via a secure web application, offering cognitive, emotional, and physical rehabilitation support. The control group will receive standard care.The primary outcome is the difference in the proportion of patients without cognitive or emotional symptoms between the two groups after one year.Secondary outcomes include changes in the level of patients' cognitive and emotional symptoms, quality of life, sleep quality, sexual interest and satisfaction, and caregivers' burden, quality of life, sleep quality and emotional symptoms in the two groups.\nDISCUSSION: The trial addresses the need for consistent post-discharge care, and the timely detection and treatment of cognitive and emotional problems. The internet-based approach allows to potentially reach many patients, ensuring cost-effectiveness and high adherence rates.The study results could establish a standard for post-OHCA care, improving long-term recovery and quality of life for survivors.Trial registration.The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06395558).",

At three months, four subtests of the performance-based Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) (Trail making, Color-word interference, Verbal fluency, and Figure design), the patient-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A), and the observer-reported 16-item Short Form (SF) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline after Cardiac Arrest (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) were collected. Spearman's rank coefficient correlation analysis was performed to examine correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A, and SF-16 IQCODE-CA.\nRESULTS: Overall, 21% of survivors exhibited impairment in executive functioning using the D-KEFS subtest Color-word interference, while only 9% self-reported executive impairment (BRIEF-A) and 7% of relatives reported cognitive decline (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) in survivors at three months post-arrest. All correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A and SF-16 IQCODE-CA were negligible to low.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this REVIVAL substudy suggest that although the performance-based and reported measures did not correlate, dual neurocognitive screening tools containing both a self-reported and an informant-reported version may have the potential to detect executive discrepancies in the return to everyday life and guide targeted neurorehabilitation after OHCA.",

Functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) holds potential to contribute to prediction of cognitive outcomes. In this study, we investigated the possible value of early changes in resting-state networks for predicting short and long-term cognitive functioning of cardiac arrest survivors. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in cardiac arrest survivors in three Dutch hospitals. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired within a month after cardiac arrest. We primarily focused on functional connectivity within the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), and additionally explored functional connectivity in seven other networks. Cognitive outcome was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during hospital admission and at 3 and 12 months, and by neuropsychological examination (NPE) at 12 months. We tested mixed effects models to evaluate the value of connectivity within the networks for predicting global cognitive outcomes at the three time points, and long-term cognitive outcomes in the memory, attention, and executive functioning domains. We included 80 patients (age 60 ± 11 years, 72 (90%) male). MoCA scores increased significantly between hospital admission and 3 months (ΔMoCA = 2.89, p < 0.01), but not between 3 and 12 months (ΔMoCA = 0.38, p = 0.52). Connectivity within the DMN, SN, and dorsal attention network (DAN) was positively related to global cognitive functioning during hospital admission (β = 0.85, p = 0.03; β = 1.48, p < 0.01; β = 0.96, p = 0.01), but not at 3 and 12 months. Network connectivity was also unrelated to long-term memory, attention, or executive functioning. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN, SN, and DAN measured in the first month after cardiac arrest is related to short-term global, but not long-term global or domain-specific cognitive performance of survivors. These results do not support the value of functional connectivity within these RSNs for prediction of long-term cognitive performance after cardiac arrest.",

Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D-5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate.\nRESULTS: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 ± 0.24 vs 0.82 ± 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 ± 21 vs 79 ± 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension.\nCONCLUSIONS: Norwegian OHCA survivors reported poorer health than the general population as assessed by the EQ-5D-5L. PROMs use in this population can be used to inform follow-up and health care delivery.",

There is limited knowledge regarding the likelihood of further recovery in the cognitive, emotional, and quality of life domains. We aimed to estimate the probability of recovery towards independency.\nMETHODS: From a prospective Registry on comatose cardiac arrest patients admitted between 2013 and 2017 in two Dutch hospitals, we included patients with a CPC3 at six months after cardiac arrest. We followed patients up to November 2023. The primary outcome measure was the CPC score at time of follow up. Secondary outcomes were scores on questionnaires on cognition, mood, and quality of life according to the minimal dataset of acquired brain injury.\nRESULTS: In our cohort of 667 patients, 29 (4.3%) had a CPC3 score at six months (median age 68 years, 83% male). At a median time of eight years after cardiac arrest, sixteen patients had died. Twelve of thirteen alive patients still had a CPC3 score (92%) and one a CPC2 (8%). Seven patients agreed with further interviewing, one showed independency in activities of daily living (14%). Six patients (86%) reported limitations due to physical and one (14%) due to emotional problems. All had severe cognitive impairment. Six (86%) missed cognitive rehabilitation.\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows that while the probability of recovery towards independence for patients with severe neurological disability at six months after cardiac arrest is limited, most long-term survivors are satisfied with their quality of life.",

Learning about the long-term outcomes is very important for developing prognostication guidelines, improving post-cardiac care, counseling caregivers about the future of their child, and creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention studies to improve outcomes. Few PICUs worldwide provide a multidisciplinary follow-up program as routine practice at an outpatient clinic with standardized measurements, using validated instruments including neuropsychological assessments by psychologists. The primary goal of such a follow-up program should be to provide excellent care to children and their caregivers, thereby resulting in a high attendance. Pediatric psychologists, neurologists and pediatricians/pediatric intensivists should ideally be involved to screen for delayed development and psychosocial problems and offer appropriate care at the same time. Preferably, outcomes should consist of evaluation of morbidity (physical and neuropsychological), functional health and Health Related Quality Of Life (QoL) of the patient and their caregivers.",

The secondary outcomes included mortality, disability, health status, and complications.\nRESULTS: Between 15th February 2019 and 31st August 2022, 113/1251 (9.0%) patients in the registry received ECPR following IHCA (mean age 50.7 ± 13.7 years; 79/113 (69.9%) male; 74/113 (65.5%) non-shockable rhythm). At 6 months, 37/113 (32.7%) patients were alive, most (27/34 [79.4%]) with a good functional outcome (mRS 0-3). Patients had increased disability [WHODAS % Score 25.58 ± 23.39% vs 6.45 ± 12.32%; mean difference (MD) [95% (confidence interval) CI] -19.13 (-28.49 to -9.77); < 0.001] and worse health status [EuroQol five-dimension, five-level (EQ-5D-5L) index value 0.73 ± 0.23 vs. 0.89 ± 0.14; MD (95% CI) 0.17 (0.07 to 0.26); = 0.003] at six months compared with the baseline. The patients reported a median of 4.5 (2-6) complications at six-month follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: One in three patients who received ECPR following IHCA were alive at six months and most had a good functional outcome. However, survivors reported higher levels of disability and a worse health status at six months compared with the baseline and ongoing complications were common.",

Cardiac arrest survivors and family members (of survivors and non-survivors) were engaged as \"experience experts,\" collaborators and co-researchers in this study.\nMETHODS: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of cardiac arrest survivors and family members was conducted. Participants were recruited from the membership of the Family Centred Cardiac Arrest Care Project. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using Framework analysis.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight participants described 22 unique cardiac arrest events. We identified five primary care need themes: 1) \"Help us help our loved one\"; 2) \"Work with us as a cohesive team\"; 3) \"See us: treat us with humanity and dignity\"; 4) \"Address our family's ongoing emergency\"; and 5) \"Help us to heal after the cardiac arrest\" as well as 29 subordinate care need themes. We performed touchpoint mapping to identify key moments of interaction between patients and families, and the health system to highlight potential areas for improvement, as well as strategies for meeting family care needs.\nCONCLUSION: Our participants identified varied family care needs during and long after cardiac arrest. Fortunately, many proposed strategies are inexpensive and have low barriers to adoption. However, some unmet care needs identified suggest larger systemic issues such as service gaps that leave families feeling abandoned and isolated. Overall, our findings suggest that care during and after cardiac arrest are critical components of a comprehensive cardiac arrest care system.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This scoping review aimed to characterise near-death experiences in the setting of cardiac arrest, a phenomenon that is poorly understood and may have clinical consequences.\nMETHOD: PubMed/MEDLINE was searched to 23 July 2023 for prospective studies describing near-death experiences in cardiac arrest. PRISMA-ScR guidelines were adhered to. Qualitative and quantitative data were synthesised. Meta-analysis was precluded due to data heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: 60 records were identified, of which 11 studies involving interviews were included from various countries. Sample size ranged from 28-344, and proportion of female patients (when reported) was 0-50%, with mean age (when reported) ranging 54-64 years. Comorbidities and reasons for cardiac arrest were heterogeneously reported. Incidence of near-death experiences in the included studies varied from 6.3% to 39.3%; with variation between in-hospital (6.3-39.3%) versus out-of-hospital (18.9-21.2%) cardiac arrest. Individual variables regarding patient characteristics demonstrated statistically significant association with propensity for near-death experiences. Reported content of near-death experiences tended to reflect the language of the questionnaires used, rather than the true language used by individual study participants. Three studies conducted follow-up, and all suggested a positive life attitude change, however one found significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with near-death experiences versus those without, in non-controlled analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: From prospective studies that have investigated the phenomenon, near-death experiences may occur in as frequent as over one-third of patients with cardiac arrest. Lasting effects may follow these events, however these could also be confounded by clinical characteristics.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Brain injury is the leading cause of death following cardiac arrest and is associated with severe neurologic disabilities among survivors, with profound implications for patients and their families, as well as broader societal impacts. How these disabilities affect long-term survival is largely unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether complete neurologic recovery at hospital discharge after cardiac arrest is associated with better long-term survival compared with moderate or severe neurologic disabilities.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from 4 mandatory national registers with structured and predefined data collection and nationwide coverage during a 10-year period in Sweden. Participants included adults who survived in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) beyond 30 days and who underwent predefined neurologic assessment conducted by health care professionals at hospital discharge using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale between January 2010 and December 2019. Patients were divided into 3 categories: complete recovery (CPC 1), moderate disabilities (CPC 2), and severe disabilities (CPC 3-4). Statistical analyses were performed in December 2023.\nEXPOSURE: CPC score at hospital discharge.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was long-term survival among patients with CPC 1 compared with those with CPC 2 or CPC 3 or 4.\nRESULTS: A total of 9390 cardiac arrest survivors (median [IQR] age, 69 .0 [58.0-77.0] years; 6544 [69.7%] male) were included. The distribution of functional neurologic outcomes at discharge was 7374 patients (78.5%) with CPC 1, 1358 patients (14.5%) with CPC 2, and 658 patients (7.0%) with CPC 3 or 4. Survival proportions at 5 years were 73.8% (95% CI, 72.5%-75.0%) for patients with CPC 1, compared with 64.7% (95% CI, 62.4%-67.0%) for patients with CPC 2 and 54.2% (95% CI, 50.6%-57.8%) for patients with CPC 3 or 4. Compared with patients with CPC 1, there was significantly higher hazard of death for patients with CPC 2 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.40-1.75]) or CPC 3 or 4 (aHR, 2.46 [95% CI, 2.13-2.85]). Similar associations were seen in the OHCA and IHCA groups.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with cardiac arrest who survived beyond 30 days, complete neurologic recovery, defined as CPC 1 at discharge, was associated with better long-term survival compared with neurologic disabilities at the same time point.",

This study describes long-term observer-reported cognitive decline among Danish OHCA survivors, including differences in years since the event, and investigates characteristics and self-reported outcomes associated with observer-reported cognitive decline.\nMETHODS: Adults who survived an OHCA from 2016 to 2019, and their relatives, completed the national DANish Cardiac Arrest Survivorship survey. Relatives completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the World Health Organisation-Five Well-being index; and survivors completed the Two Simple Questions (everyday activities and mental recovery), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, HADS, and the Short World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Potential associations between survivor characteristics and the IQCODE-CA were investigated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Self-reported outcomes among survivors and relatives, and the association with IQCODE-CA scores were investigated using separate logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Total median IQCODE-CA score was 3.04 (IQR: 3.00-3.27), with 47% having possible cognitive decline (score ≥ 3.04), consistent across time groups. Increasing age (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) and worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes for survivors and relatives, except 'everyday activities' were significantly associated with possible cognitive decline among survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of OHCA survivors may suffer long-term cognitive decline. Worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes among survivors and their relatives are associated with potential cognitive decline emphasising the need for post-OHCA care to include systematic neurocognitive assessment, tailored support and effective rehabilitation.",

This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93). More than one-third of cardiac arrest survivors experience symptoms of PICS 2 years after resuscitation, with the highest impairment observed in the physical and psychological domains. However, long-term survivors of cardiac arrest report intact health-related quality of life when compared to the general population. Future research should focus on appropriate prevention, screening, and treatment strategies for PICS in cardiac arrest patients.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cognitive function is often impaired for cardiac arrest (CA) survivors due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Whether cognitive impairment at hospital discharge is associated with recovery defined as functional status and fatigue measured at 1-month post-discharge is not known.\nMETHODS: Consecutive CA patients admitted at an academic center (May 14, 2021-June 23, 2023) were assessed for cognitive impairment (modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-m < 33) and depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire) at hospital discharge. Poor functional status (primary outcome; modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3) and fatigue severity (patient-reported outcome; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were assessed 1-month post-discharge. Hierarchical regressions tested associations of cognitive function with outcomes.\nRESULTS: Of 112 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 14.8; 38% female; 43% White race, 20% Black race, 29% Hispanic ethnicity) completing discharge TICS-m, 63 (56%) had indicated cognitive impairment, and 68 (61%) had poor 1-month functional outcome. Worse discharge cognitive function was independently associated with a higher risk of poor 1-month functional outcome (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02) after adjusting for age, education, sex, race, ethnicity, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and depressive symptoms. Fatigue severity lacked significant associations with cognitive function, but was associated with depressive symptoms (B = 1.03 [0.00, 2.05], p = 0.04).\nCONCLUSION: Cognitive function at discharge after CA was significantly and independently associated with functional outcome 1 month after hospital discharge. Psychological distress contributed to fatigue severity. This highlights the need for screening and addressing cognitive and emotional problems pre-hospital discharge.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately half of cardiac arrest survivors have persistent cognitive impairment. Guidelines recommend early screening to identify patients at risk for cognitive impairment, but there is no consensus on the best screening method. We aimed to identify quantitative EEG measures relating with short- and long-term cognitive function after cardiac arrest for potential to cognitive outcome prediction.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study designed to develop a prediction model for cognitive outcome after cardiac arrest. For the current analysis, we used twenty-minute EEG registrations from 80 patients around one week after cardiac arrest. We calculated power spectral density, normalized alpha-to-theta ratio (nATR), peak frequency, and center of gravity (CoG) of this peak frequency. We related these with global cognitive functioning (scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) at one week, three and twelve months follow-up with multivariate mixed effect models, and with performance on standard neuropsychological examination at twelve months using Pearson correlation coefficients.\nRESULTS: Each individual EEG parameter related to MoCA at one week (β = 7.36; P < 0.01; βfrequency = 1.73, P < 0.01; β = -9.88, P < 0.01). The nATR also related with the MoCA at three months ((β = 2.49; P 0.01). No EEG metrics significantly related to the MoCA score at twelve months. nATR and peak frequency related with memory performance at twelve months. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSION: Early resting-state EEG parameters relate with short-term global cognitive functioning and with memory function at one year after cardiac arrest. Additional predictive values in multimodal prediction models need further study.",

The objective of this study was to assess components of return to work among OHCA survivors.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the French national multicentric cohort AfterRosc to include OHCA survivors admitted between April 1st 2021 and March 31st 2022, discharged alive from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who were less than 65 years old. A phone-call interview was performed one year after OHCA to assess return to work, level of education, former level of occupation as well as neurological recovery. Geographic and socio-economic data from the patient's residential neighborhoods were also collected. Comparisons were performed between patients who returned to work and those who did not, using non-parametric tests.\nRESULTS: Of the 251 patients included in the registry, 86 were alive at ICU discharge and 31 patients that worked prior to the OHCA were included for analysis. Seventeen survivors returned to work after a median delay of 112 days [92-157] Among them, nine (53%) had required initial work adjustments. Overall, only 6 patients (19%) had returned to work ad integrum. Higher educational level, work which required higher competence-level, higher income, living in a better socio-economical neighborhood, as well as better scores on all three standardized MPAI-4 score components (abilities, adjustment and participation) were significantly associated with return to work. Participants that had not returned to work had a significant drop of income (p = 0.0025).\nCONCLUSION: In this prospective study regarding French OHCA survivors, return to work is associated with better socio-economical individual and environmental status, as well as better scores on all MPAI-4 components.",

However, survivors managed with ECPR are at risk of poor functional status. The purpose of this study was to investigate return to work (RTW) after refractory OHCA.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Of 44 360 patients with OHCA in the period of 2011 to 2020, this nationwide registry-based study included 805 patients with refractory OHCA in the working age (18-65 years) who were employed before OHCA (2% of the total OHCA cohort). Demographics, prehospital characteristics, status at hospital arrival, employment status, and survival were retrieved through the Danish national registries. Sustainable RTW was defined as RTW for ≥6 months without any long sick leave relapses. Median follow-up time was 4.1 years. ECPR and standard advanced cardiovascular life support were applied in 136 and 669 patients, respectively. RTW 1 year after OHCA was similar (39% versus 54%;=0.2) and sustainable RTW was high in both survivors managed with ECPR and survivors managed with standard advanced cardiovascular life support (83% versus 85%;>0.9). Younger age and shorter length of hospitalization were associated with RTW in multivariable Cox analysis, whereas ECPR was not.\nCONCLUSIONS: In refractory OHCA-patients employed prior to OHCA, approximately 1 out of 2 patients were employed after 1 year with no difference between patients treated with ECPR or standard advanced cardiovascular life support. Younger age and shorter length of hospitalization were associated with RTW while ECPR was not.",

Four major databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO; January 1995-January 2022, updated July 2023) for qualitative studies exploring survivors' and/or key supporters' experiences of cardiac arrest survival. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) were applied to evaluate the overall confidence in research findings. Constructs were identified from each paper, informing theme and sub-theme development.\nRESULTS: From 15,917 unique titles/abstracts and 196 full-text articles, 32 met the inclusion criteria. Three themes captured the survivors' experiences: 1) Making sense of my cardiac arrest; 2) Learning to trust my body and mind; and 3) Re-evaluating my life. A further three themes reflected key supporters' experiences: 1) Emotional turmoil; 2) Becoming a carer: same person but different me; and 3) Engaging with a new and unknown world. However, limited data and some methodological weaknesses in included studies reduced confidence in several themes. The findings were conceived within the overarching concept of 'negotiating a new normal'.\nCONCLUSIONS: The enduring psychosocial and physical sequelae of cardiac arrest survival substantially impacts the lives of survivors and their key supporters, requiring negotiation of their 'new normality'. The need for sense-making, physical and psychological recovery, and the new roles for key supporters should be strong considerations in the development of future interventions.",

The lived experiences of post-cardiac arrest survival have been underexplored. The themes that resulted from the analysis in this scoping review can inform clinical practice and propose strategies to improve the patients' quality of life.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to map out qualitative literature that explores the lived experience of individuals who have survived cardiac arrest.\nMETHOD: In this scoping review, the authors examined peer-reviewed qualitative studies identified in the PubMed, CINAHL, and MEDLINE databases. Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting a scoping study was followed.\nRESULTS: The search yielded 174 articles, with 16 meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Initially, 14 articles were selected, and 2 additional articles were identified through references. Themes extracted from these 16 articles include the need for support and information, emotional challenges, and acceptance of a new reality.\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac arrest survivors often experience loss of control, vulnerability, and insecurity. These emotional changes can be significant and may include physical challenges, cognitive impairments, and psychological distress, which can cause individuals to reevaluate their perspectives on life and accept a new reality, potentially leading to changes in their future outlook.",

However, little is known about the health-related quality of life of long-term survivors. Purpose: We conducted a nationwide survey to examine the long-term quality of life of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors from 2001-2019. Methods: The study included all out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry between 2001-2019 who were alive in October 2020. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the EuroQol health questionnaire (EQ-5D), SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Of the 4,545 survivors, 2,552 (56.1 %) completed the survey. Respondent and non-respondent age was comparable (67 vs. 68 years). The median EQ-index score for survivors who had been alive for 0-1 year was 0.8 (Q1-Q3: 0.7-1.0), while survivors who had been alive for 15-20 years had a median EQ-index score of 0.9 (0.8-1.0). These scores were comparable to a Danish reference population, whose mean EQ-index score was 0.9 (SD: 0.16). Mean standardized SF-12 physical health score was 40.6 (SD: 12.7) for 0-1 year survivors vs. 44.4 (SD: 11.8) for >15-20-year survivors, and the SF-12 mental health score was 53.1 (SD: 8.4) vs. 54.1 (SD: 8.7), respectively. Both scores were comparable to a Danish reference population. In terms of symptoms of anxiety, 73% of survivors who had been alive for 0-1 year reported a normal score (score ≤ 8), compared to 89.3% of survivors who had been alive for 15-20 years. For symptoms of depression, the percentages were 79.7% and 87.5%, respectively (Figure 1). Health-related quality of life was similar for survivor groups >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, and >10-15 years after arrest. Conclusion: Short-term as well as long-term survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest generally reported high health-related quality of life after the event, regardless of the time elapsed since the arrest.",

Aims: The aim of the DESAC study was to describe mid- and long-term survival and neurological status of CA survivors, and to assess the influence of pre- and intra-hospital therapeutic strategies on these outcomes. Methods: Between Jul 2015 and Oct 2018, patients over 18 years who were discharged alive from intensive care units in Paris and suburbs (France) after a non-traumatic CA were included and interviewed every 6 months during at least 24 months and up to 48 months in this multicentric study. Factors associated with Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale at 24 months were assessed with logistic regression, with CPC 1 or 2 level considered as a favorable neurological outcome. Trajectories of CPC were derived by mixed linear model in survivors with at least 3 evaluations. Results: Out of 593 survivors, 525 had a 24 months follow-up (mean age 57.6 +/-15.3, 79% men). CA occurred in public location in 251/525, with an initial shockable rhythm in 392/525. Prognostic factors independently associated with a favorable neurological outcome at 24 months were initial shockable rhythm (OR= 3.53 (1.65; 7.58)) and previous practice of sport (OR= 3.12 (1.20 ; 8.11)), whereas older age (OR per 10 years= 0.52 (0.40; 0.68)) and previous ischemic cardiomyopathy (OR= 0.34 (0.15 ; 0.77)) were poor prognostic factors. Therapeutic hypothermia or coronary procedures were not related to prognosis. Five trajectories of CPC could be derived among the 514 patients. Overall, 64% remained in CPC1, 13% in CPC2, 11% improved from CPC2 to CPC 12% died either early or lately (Figure 1). Conclusions: In this multicentric and prospective study, practice of sport and shockable rhythm were strongly associated with a favorable neurological recovery at 24 months. Furthermore, two thirds of the survivors remained in CPC 1 over time.",

    "abstract": "Background: Interventions addressing highly prevalent psychological distress in caregivers of cardiac arrest (CA) survivors are lacking.We conducted a prospective study to confirm our previous findings of information-based needs as the highest priority in a cross-sectionalsurvey of caregivers of CA survivors. Methods: Adult caregivers of CA survivors hospitalized at Columbia University Medical Center were eligible for recruitment.Caregivers completed an interview after transfer from the intensive care unit (ICU) to inpatient floors and a follow-up interview 1-monthpost-discharge. Interviews allowed for initial free response, followed by prompts for opinions on eight potential interventions addressingpatient-centered needs (i.e., CA education, information on neurological recovery or rehabilitation, having a designated member of thecare team) and caregiver-centered needs (i.e., peer-to-peer support, hospital-based resources, formal psychotherapy, self-care). Interviewtranscripts were used to identify top-ranked needs and temporal changes between post-ICU and 1-month post-discharge. Results: Of 33 caregivers who participated in post-ICU interviews between August 2021-July 2022, 22 who also completed 1-monthinterviews were analyzed. The highest ranked need during acute care (n=10; 45.5%) and 1-month post-discharge (n=8; 36.4%) wasaccess to a designated member of the patient’s medical care team to answer the caregiver’s questions throughout hospitalization and thetransition home. Patient-centered needs accounted for 81.8% (n=18) of caregiver desire for interventions at both time points. 37% (n=8)of caregivers shifted focus between patient- and caregiver-centered needs, observed in both directions, between the two interviews. Conclusions: Caregivers of CA survivors self-reported their greatest need during hospitalization and a month after hospital dischargeas access to trusted resources about their loved one’s medical condition. Studies with a longer follow-up to understand caregivers’journeys and timing of the switch from patient-to caregiver-centered needs are warranted.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The recent American Heart Association guidelines added a sixth link in the chain of survival highlighting recovery and emphasized the importance of psychiatric outcome and recovery for survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among this population was higher than that in the general population.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of depression or anxiety and the association of these conditions with long-term mortality among individuals who survive OHCA.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal population-based cohort study was conducted to analyze long-term prognosis in patients hospitalized for OHCA between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2015, who survived for 1 year or longer. Patients with cardiac arrest due to traumatic or nonmedical causes, such as injuries, poisoning, asphyxiation, burns, or anaphylaxis, were excluded. Data were extracted on depression or anxiety diagnoses in this population within 1 year from the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service and analyzed April 7, 2022, and reanalyzed January 19 to 20, 2023.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Follow-up data were obtained for up to 14 years, and the primary outcome was long-term cumulative mortality. Long-term mortality among patients with and without a diagnosis of depression or anxiety were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The analysis included 2373 patients; 1860 (78.4%) were male, and the median age was 53.0 (IQR, 44.0-62.0) years . A total of 397 (16.7%) patients were diagnosed with depression or anxiety, 251 (10.6%) were diagnosed with depression, and 227 (9.6%) were diagnosed with anxiety. The incidence of long-term mortality was significantly higher in the group diagnosed with depression or anxiety than in the group without depression or anxiety (141 of 397 [35.5%] vs 534 of 1976 [27.0%]; P = .001). With multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of long-term mortality for total patients with depression or anxiety was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.17-1.70); depression, 1.44 (95% CI, 1.16-1.79); and anxiety, 1.20 (95% CI, 0.94-1.53).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, among the patients who experienced OHCA, those diagnosed with depression or anxiety had higher long-term mortality rates than those without depression or anxiety. These findings suggest that psychological and neurologic rehabilitation intervention for survivors of OHCA may be needed to improve long-term survival.",

HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure.\nRESULTS: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1-q3) = 70 (50-80). Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 4-8% of the total variance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Since IHCA survivors with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous stroke.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive activity and awareness during cardiac arrest (CA) are reported but ill understood. This first of a kind study examined consciousness and its underlying electrocortical biomarkers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nMETHODS: In a prospective 25-site in-hospital study, we incorporated a) independent audiovisual testing of awareness, including explicit and implicit learning using a computer and headphones, with b) continuous real-time electroencephalography(EEG) and cerebral oxygenation(rSO) monitoring into CPR during in-hospital CA (IHCA). Survivors underwent interviews to examine for recall of awareness and cognitive experiences. A complementary cross-sectional community CA study provided added insights regarding survivors' experiences.\nRESULTS: Of 567 IHCA, 53(9.3%) survived, 28 of these (52.8%) completed interviews, and 11(39.3%) reported CA memories/perceptions suggestive of consciousness. Four categories of experiences emerged: 1) emergence from coma during CPR (CPR-induced consciousness [CPRIC]) 2/28(7.1%), or 2) in the post-resuscitation period 2/28(7.1%), 3) dream-like experiences 3/28(10.7%), 4) transcendent recalled experience of death (RED) 6/28(21.4%). In the cross-sectional arm, 126 community CA survivors' experiences reinforced these categories and identified another: delusions (misattribution of medical events). Low survival limited the ability to examine for implicit learning. Nobody identified the visual image, 1/28(3.5%) identified the auditory stimulus. Despite marked cerebral ischemia (Mean rSO = 43%) normal EEG activity (delta, theta and alpha) consistent with consciousness emerged as long as 35-60 minutes into CPR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consciousness. awareness and cognitive processes may occur during CA. The emergence of normal EEG may reflect a resumption of a network-level of cognitive activity, and a biomarker of consciousness, lucidity and RED (authentic \"near-death\" experiences).",

We then used experience-based co-design to develop a family-centred out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care policy and procedure template.\nRESULTS: Thirty-five Canadian EMS organizations responded to our requests, representing service area coverage for 80% of the Canadian population. Twenty documents were obtained for review and six overarching themes were identified: addressing family in event of in-home death, importance of family, family member escort, provider discretion and family presence discouraged. Informed by our qualitative analysis we then co-designed a policy and procedure template was created that prioritizes patient care while promotes family-centredness.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were few directives to support family-centred care by Canadian EMS organizations. A family-centred out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care policy and procedure template was developed using experience-based co-design to assist EMS organizations improve the family-centredness of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care.",

However, experiences of caring for an OHCA survivor are sparsely described. Thus, this study aimed to explore how family caregivers of OHCA survivors experience the potential burden.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using an explorative qualitative approach, six focus group interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 family caregivers of OHCA survivors and analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach inspired by the philosophy of Ricoeur. The OHCA survivors attended a rehabilitation course, and the family caregivers were interviewed as part of the course.Based on the analysis, three themes emerged: (i) feeling unexpectedly alone and invisible; the family caregivers experienced an emotional burden that could not be shared-leading to caregiving being a lonely experience, (ii) fear of loss; the fear of losing a loved one was a constant companion contributing to the burden, and (iii) adjusting to a new everyday life; the family caregivers had difficulties adjusting to living their lives on the premise of the survivors' needs.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study emphasize the burden experienced by family caregivers and how they can be trapped in competing emotions and tensions. The possible caregiver burden following OHCA should be acknowledged. Interventions to reduce the burden should be tested and implemented as part of the clinical care of OHCA survivors and their families.",

We aimed to provide insight into these outcomes at one-year follow-up.\nMETHODS: We assessed outcome of surviving comatose patients after cardiac arrest with RPPs included in the 'treatment of electroencephalographic status epilepticus after cardiopulmonary resuscitation' (TELSTAR) trial at one-year follow-up, including the CPC for functional neurological outcome, a cognitive assessment, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) for emotional outcomes, and the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) for quality of life. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of more than 1.5 SD below the mean on ≥ 2 (sub)tests within a cognitive domain.\nRESULTS: Fourteen patients were included (median age 58 years, 21% female), of whom 13 had a cognitive impairment. Eleven of 14 were impaired in memory, 9/14 in executive functioning, and 7/14 in attention. The median scores on the HADS and SF-36 were all worse than expected. Based on the CPC alone, 8/14 had a good outcome (CPC 1-2).\nCONCLUSION: Nearly all cardiac arrest survivors with RPPs during the comatose state have cognitive impairments at one-year follow-up. The incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms seem relatively high and quality of life relatively poor, despite 'good' outcomes according to the CPC.",

At three-month follow-up, we evaluated cognitive impairment with a neuropsychological test battery and symptoms of psychopathology were re-assessed using HADS and IES-R. Logistic regression models were applied to examine associations between screening results and outcomes.\nRESULTS: This study included 297 OHCA survivors. During hospitalisation, 65% presented with cognitive impairment, 25% reported symptoms of anxiety, 20% symptoms of depression and 21% symptoms of traumatic distress. At follow-up, 53% reported cognitive impairment, 17% symptoms of anxiety, 15% symptoms of depression and 19% symptoms of traumatic distress. Cognitive impairment during hospitalisation was associated with higher odds (OR (95% CI) 2.55 (1.36-4.75), p = .02) of an unfavorable cognitive outcome at follow-up, and symptoms of psychopathology during hospitalisation were associated with higher odds of psychopathology at follow-up across all three symptom groups; anxiety (6.70 (2.40-18.72), p < .001), depression (4.69 (1.69-13.02), p < .001) and traumatic distress (7.07 (2.67-18.73), p < .001).\nCONCLUSION: OHCA survivors exhibited both cognitive impairment and symptoms of psychopathology during hospitalisation comparable to previous studies, which were associated with unfavorable mental health outcomes at three-month follow-up.",

We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders using the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases checklist. There is broad-based acknowledgement of the relevance of cognitive impairment and a positive attitude regarding early cognitive screening among health professionals and patients. Barriers to implementation include a lack of practical recommendations on how, where and when to screen, insufficient knowledge of cognitive consequences of cardiac arrest, insufficient collaboration and knowledge sharing among different specialties within hospitals, insufficient resources, and insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of screening and therapy to justify financial compensation. Most of the identified barriers to implementation are solvable: national guidelines need practical recommendations and knowledge gaps among healthcare workers can be bridged by in-hospital collaboration. Fulfilling these requirements should be sufficient for the implementation of simple screening and tailored advice. More extensive cognitive rehabilitation therapy needs stronger evidence of efficacy in order to warrant stronger guideline recommendations and financial reimbursement.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has a dismal prognosis with overall survival around 10%. Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the prevalence and significance of comorbidities in OHCA, as well as the underlying causes. Previously, 80% of sudden cardiac arrest have been attributed to coronary artery disease. We studied comorbidities and discharge diagnoses in OHCA in all of Sweden.\nMETHODS: We used the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, merged with the Inpatient Registry and Outpatient Registry to identify patients with OHCA from 2010 to 2020 and to collect all their comorbidities as well as discharge diagnoses (among those admitted to hospital). Patient characteristics were described using means, medians and SD. Survival curves were performed among hospitalised patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as well as heart failure.\nRESULTS: A total of 54 484 patients with OHCA were included, of whom 35 894 (66%) were men. The most common comorbidities prior to OHCA were hypertension (43.6%), heart failure (23.6%), chronic ischaemic heart disease (23.6%) and atrial fibrillation (22.0%). Previous AMI was prevalent in 14.8% of men and 10.9% of women. Among women, 18.0% had type 2 diabetes, compared with 19.6% of the men. Among hospitalised patients, 30% were diagnosed with AMI, 27% with hypertension, 20% with ischaemic heart disease and 18% with heart failure as discharge diagnoses.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, we find evidence that nowadays a minority of cardiac arrests are due to coronary artery disease and AMIs and its complications. Only 30% of all cases of OHCA admitted to hospital were diagnosed with AMI. Coronary artery disease is now likely in the minority with regard to causes of OHCA.",

The DALY due to pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States is unknown. We aimed to estimate pediatric OHCA DALY and to compare it with the other leading causes of pediatric death and disability in the United States.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of the national Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival database. DALY were calculated as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. Years of life lost were calculated using all pediatric (age <18 years) nontraumatic OHCA from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival from 2016 to 2020. Disability weights based on cerebral performance category scores, an outcome measure of neurologic function, were used to estimate years lived with disability . Data were reported as total, mean, and rate per 100 000 individuals, and were compared with the leading causes of pediatric DALY in the United States published by the Global Burden of Disease study for 2019.\nRESULTS: Totally 11 177 OHCA met the study inclusion criteria. A modest increase in total OHCA DALY in the United States was observed from 407 500 (years of life lost = 407 435 and years lived with disability =65) in 2016 to 415 113 (years of life lost = 415 055 and years lived with disability =58) in 2020. The DALY rate increased from 553.3 per 100 000 individuals in 2016 to 568.3 per 100 000 individuals in 2020. For 2019, OHCA was the 10th leading cause of pediatric DALY lost behind neonatal disorders, injuries, mental disorders, premature birth, musculoskeletal disorders, congenital birth defects, skin diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and asthma.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nontraumatic OHCA is one of the top 10 leading causes of annual pediatric DALY lost in the United States.",

DALY were calculated as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. The years of life lost were calculated using all adult IHCA with complete data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database for 2015 to 2019. Cerebral performance category scores and published disability weights were used to estimate the years lived with disability for survivors. The cohort's DALY were extrapolated to a national level to estimate the total United States DALY and were compared with a published ranking of the leading causes of DALY in the United States for 2018. Data were reported as DALY total and rate per 100,000. A total of 99,897 IHCA were included from 329 hospitals. The total IHCA DALY increased from 2,208,310 in 2015 to 2,225,722 in 2019. A modest decrease in the DALY rate was observed from 689 per 100,000 in 2015 to 678 per 100,000 in 2019. In 2018, the rate of IHCA DALY were 728 per 100,000, which represented the 11th leading cause of DALY. When combined with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (1,322 per 100,000), sudden cardiac arrest (2,050 per 100,000) was found the be the 2nd leading cause of DALY after ischemic heart disease (2,681 per 100,000) in 2018. In conclusion, adult IHCA is a leading cause of DALY in the United States and has increased over time because of the expansion of the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database.",

    "abstract": "Background Survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) experience ongoing physical and cognitive impairments, often requiring support from a caregiver at home afterwards. Caregivers are important in the survivor's recovery, yet there is little research specifically focused on their experiences once the survivor is discharged home. In this study, we highlight how caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors described and experienced their caregiver role, the strategies they used to fulfill their role, and the additional needs they still have years after the IHCA event. Methods and Results Between March and July 2019, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 12 caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors. Interviews were transcribed, and content analysis was performed. Patterns within the data were further analyzed and grouped into themes. A predominant theme of \"disruption\" was identified across 3 different domains including the following: (1) disruption in caregiver's life, (2) disruption in caregiver-patient relationship, and (3) disruption in caregiver's well-being. Disruption was associated with both positive and negative caregiver experiences. Strategies caregivers used and resources they felt would have helped them adjust to their caregiver role were also identified. Conclusions Caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors experienced a disruption in many facets of their lives. Caregivers felt the veterans' IHCA impacted various aspects of their lives, and they continued to need additional support in order to care for the IHCA survivor and themselves. Although some were able to procure coping strategies, such as counseling and engaging in stress-relieving activities, most indicated additional help and resources were still needed.",

Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The study followed the guidelines outlined in the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist.\nRESULTS: The participants felt insignificant and abandoned following the in-hospital cardiac arrest. Surviving patients and their close family members felt excluded, alone and abandoned throughout the care process; relationships, emotions and daily life were affected and gave rise to existential distress. Three themes and eight subordinate themes were identified: (1) the intrusion of death-powerless in the face of the fragility of life, highlights what it is like to suffer a cardiac arrest and to cope with an immediate threat to life; (2) being totally exposed-feeling vulnerable in the care relationship, describes how a lack of care from healthcare staff damaged trust; (3) learning to live again-making sense of an existential threat, pertaining to the family's reactions to a difficult event that impacts relationships but also leads to a greater appreciation of life and a positive view of the future.\nCONCLUSION: Surviving and witnessing a cardiac arrest in-hospital is a critical event for everyone involved. Patients and family members are vulnerable in this situation and need to be seen and heard, both in the hospital and after hospital discharge. Consequently, healthcare staff need to show compassion and attend to the needs of the family, which involves continually assessing how family members are coping during the process, and providing support and information during and after resuscitation.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is important to provide support to family members who witness the resuscitation of a loved one in-hospital. Structured follow-up care is crucial for cardiac arrest survivors and their families. To promote person-centred care, nurses need interprofessional training on how to support family members during resuscitation, and follow-up care focusing on providing resources for multiple challenges faced by survivors (emotional, cognitive, physical) and families (emotional) is needed.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: In-hospital cardiac arrest patients and family members were involved when designing the study.",

Knowledge about the circumstances of this specific setting has mainly been limited to quantitative data. To develop a more conceptual understanding of the circumstances and dynamics of 'at-home CA', we conducted a qualitative interview study.\nMETHODS: Twenty-one semi-structured in-depth interviews were performed with laypersons who had witnessed 'at-home CA'. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed by qualitative content analysis (QCA). A category system was developed to classify facilitating and impeding factors and to finally derive overarching concepts of 'at-home CA'.\nRESULTS: Qualitative Content Analysis yielded 1'347 relevant interview segments. Of these, 398 related to factors facilitating B-CPR, 328 to factors impeding, and 621 were classified neutral. Some of these factors were specific to 'at-home CA'. The privacy context was found to be a particularly supportive factor, as it enhanced the commitment to act and facilitated the detection of symptoms. Impeding factors, aggravated in 'at-home CA' settings, included limited support from other bystanders, acute stress response and impaired situational judgement, as well as physical challenges when positioning the patient. We derived six overarching concepts defining the 'at-home CA' situation: (a) unexpectedness of the event, (b) acute stress response, (c) situational judgement, (d) awareness of the necessity to perform B-CPR, (e) initial position of the patient, (f) automaticity of actions.\nCONCLUSION: Integrating these concepts into dispatch protocols and layperson training may improve dispatcher-bystander interaction and the outcomes of 'at-home CA'.",

Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise habits prior to OHCA. Respondents were randomly matched 1:1 for age and sex with a reference population (data were available from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data).\nRESULTS: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised ≥5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly ( < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical- and mental health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting ≥5 hours of exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less.\nCONCLUSION: Poorer HRQoL in survivors compared to the reference population should prompt us to explore how treatment and rehabilitation could be improved and adapted. More exercise before OHCA favoured better HRQoL after, which aligns well with the recognised positive association between HRQoL and physical activity in general.",

Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether symptoms of insomnia are associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors six months after the event.\nMETHODS: This multicentre cross-sectional survey included cardiac arrest survivors ≥18 years. Participants were recruited six months after the event from five hospitals in southern Sweden, and completed a questionnaire including the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale, EQ-5D-5L, Health Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, linear regression, and ordinal logistic regression. The regression analyses were adjusted for demographic and medical factors.\nRESULTS: In total, 212 survivors, 76.4% males, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD = 11.9) were included, and of those, 20% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia was significantly associated with all aspects of self-reported health ( < 0.01) and life satisfaction ( < 0.001), except mobility ( = 0.093), self-care ( = 0.676), and usual activities ( = 0.073).\nCONCLUSION: Insomnia plays a potentially important role for both health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening for sleep problems should be part of post cardiac arrest care and follow-up to identify those in need of further medical examination and treatment.",

    "abstract": "After cardiac arrest (CA), some patients report impressions with highly realistic features, often referred to as near-death experience (NDE). The frequency of such episodes seems to be variable, with various types of content. In a prospective study, we subjected 126 CA cases treated at the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna under carefully controlled conditions to a structured interview. We included all patients admitted due to CA, whose communicative abilities were restored and who agreed to participate in the study. The questionnaire inquired as to living conditions, attitudes towards issues of life and death, and last recollections before and first impressions after the CA. The majority of the subjects (91 = 76%) replied to inquiries concerning impressions during CA with \"nothing\" or \"blackout\", but 20 (16%) gave a detailed account. A German version of the Greyson questionnaire specifically addressing NDE phenomena (included towards the end of the interview) resulted in ≥7 points in five patients (4%). Three patients reported a meeting with deceased relatives (one with 6 Greyson points), one an out-of-body episode, and one having been sucked into a colorful tunnel. Eleven of these twenty cases had their cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) started within the first min of CA, a higher fraction than cases without experience. Reported experience after CA was of high significance for the patients; many of them changed their point of view on issues of life and death.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most cardiac arrest (CA) survivors report good health and quality of life. Life satisfaction on the other hand has not yet been studied in a large scale in the CA population. We aimed to explore life satisfaction as perceived by CA survivors with three research questions addressed: (1) how do CA survivors report their life satisfaction, (2) how are different domains of life satisfaction associated with overall life satisfaction, and (3) how are demographic and medical factors associated with overall life satisfaction?\nMETHODS: This registry study had a cross-sectional design. Life satisfaction was assessed using the 11-item Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11). The sample included 1435 survivors ≥18 years of age. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were used.\nRESULTS: Survivors were most satisfied with partner relation (85.6%), family life (82.2%), and self-care (77.8%), while 60.5% were satisfied with overall life. Satisfaction with psychological health was strongest associated with overall life satisfaction. Among medical and demographic factors, female sex and poor cerebral performance were associated with less overall life satisfaction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Generally, CA survivors seem to perceive similar levels of overall life satisfaction as general populations, while survivors tend to be significantly less satisfied with their sexual life. Satisfaction with psychological health is of special interest to identify and treat. Additionally, female survivors and survivors with poor neurological outcome are at risk for poorer overall life satisfaction and need special attention by healthcare professionals.",

Survivors were included after they signed (or the proxies) an informed consent before discharge during initial hospitalisation. We calculated that including 600 patients in total would allow an 80% power to demonstrate a 2 years survival rate difference of 10% between patients who did and those who did not receive therapeutic hypothermia after resuscitation. Pre- and in-hospital data related to the circumstances surrounding the event and to the therapeutic interventions (such as cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation, emergent coronary revascularization, neuroprotective therapeutics) were collected. After discharge, patients were interviewed at 3 months, 6 months and every year thereafter for a minimum follow-up of 26 months and a maximum follow-up of 48 months. Information on vital status, occurrence of cardiovascular events, medications and a comprehensive assessment of the functional status (qualitive of life as assessed by the Short-Form General Health Survey (SF36) scale, activities of daily living (ADL) scale, neurological Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) and Overall Performance Categories (OPC) scales, socio-professional activities) were collected at follow-up interviews.\nDISCUSSION: The DESAC study should provide important information regarding several dimensions of the mid and long-term prognosis of cardiac arrest survivors and on the benefit (and potentially harm) of early therapeutic strategies.",

We aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes in pediatric OHCA survivors more than one year after cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: OHCA survivors <18 years old who received post-cardiac arrest care in the PICU at a single center between 2008-2018 were included. Parents of patients <18 years and patients ≥18 years at least one year after cardiac arrest completed a telephone interview. We assessed neurologic outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category [PCPC]), activities of daily living (Pediatric Glasgow Outcomes Scale-Extended, Functional Status Scale (FSS)), HRQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Core and Family Impact Modules), and healthcare utilization. Unfavorable neurologic outcome was defined as PCPC > 1 or worsening from pre-arrest baseline to discharge.\nFINDINGS: Forty four patients were evaluable. Follow-up occurred at a median of 5.6 years [IQR 4.4, 8.9] post-arrest. Median age at arrest was 5.3 [1.3,12.6] years; median CPR duration was 5 [1.5, 7] minutes. Survivors with unfavorable outcome at discharge had worse FSS Sensory and Motor Function scores and higher rates of rehabilitation service utilization. Parents of survivors with unfavorable outcome reported greater disruption to family functioning. Healthcare utilization and educational support requirements were common among all survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survivors of pediatric OHCA with unfavorable outcome at discharge have more impaired function multiple years post-arrest. Survivors with favorable outcome may experience impairments and significant healthcare needs not fully captured by the PCPC at hospital discharge.",

The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.\nEXPOSURE: All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.\nRESULTS: Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population. These findings support resource allocation and efforts targeted to increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",

In patients with MI, the association between CS and OHCA and need for home care or nursing home admission was examined.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Danish nationwide registries identified patients with MI (2008-19), who prior to the event lived at home without home care and discharged alive. One-year cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) were reported for home care need or nursing home admission, a composite proxy for disability in activities of daily living (ADL), along with all-cause mortality. The study population consisted of 67 109 patients with MI (by groups: -OHCA/-CS: 63 644; -OHCA/+CS: 1776; +OHCA/-CS: 968; and +OHCA/+CS: 721). The 1-year cumulative incidences of home care/nursing home were 7.1% for patients who survived to discharge with -OHCA/-CS, 20.9% for -OHCA/+CS, 5.4% for +OHCA/-CS, and 8.2% for those with +OHCA/+CS. The composite outcome was driven by home care. With the -OHCA/-CS as reference, the adjusted HRs for home care/nursing home were 2.86 (95% CI: 2.57-3.19) for patients with -OHCA/+CS; 1.31 (95% CI: 1.00-1.73) for + OHCA/-CS; and 2.18 (95% CI: 1.68-2.82) for those with +OHCA/+CS. The 1-year cumulative mortality were 5.1% for patients with -OHCA/-CS, 9.8% for -OHCA/+CS, 3.0% for +OHCA/-CS, and 3.4% for those with +OHCA/+CS.\nCONCLUSION: In patients discharged alive after a MI, CS, and to a lesser degree OHCA were associated with impaired ADL with a two-fold higher 1-year incidence of home care or nursing home admission compared with MI patients without CS or OHCA.",

    "abstract": "Post-cardiac arrest brain injury constitutes a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, leading to cognitive impairment and subsequent disability. Individuals within this patient cohort grapple with uncertainty regarding the potential advantages of extracorporeal life support (ECMO) cannulation. This study elucidates the neurological outcomes and quality of life of post-cardiac arrest patients who attained spontaneous circulation and underwent ECMO cannulation. This is a retrospective case study within a local context, the research involved 32 patients who received ECMO support following an intrahospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). An additional 32 patients experienced cardiac arrest with ROSC before undergoing cannulation. The average age was 41 years, with the primary causes of cardiac arrest identified as acute coronary syndrome (46.8%), pulmonary thromboembolism (21.88%), and hypoxemia (18.7%). The most prevalent arrest rhythm was asystole (37.5%), followed by ventricular fibrillation (34.4%). The mean SOFA score was 7 points (IQR 6.5-9), APACHE II score was 12 (IQR 9-16), RESP score was -1 (IQR -1 to -4) in cases of respiratory ECMO, and SAVE score was -3 (IQR -5 to 2) in cases of cardiac ECMO. Overall survival was 71%, and at 6 months, the Barthel score was 75 points, modified Rankin score was 2, cerebral performance categories score was 1, and the SF-12 had an average score of 30. Notably, there were no significant associations between the time, cause, or rhythm of cardiac arrest and neurological outcomes. Importantly, cardiac arrest is not a contraindication for ECMO cannulation. A meticulous assessment of candidates who have achieved spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest, considering the absence of early signs of poor neurological prognosis, is crucial in patient selection. Larger prospective studies are warranted to validate and extend these findings.",

    "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Fragestellung Für Deutschland liegen nur wenige Daten zum Gesundheitszustand und Langzeitüberleben nach außerklinischer Reanimation vor. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht den allgemeinen Gesundheitszustand und das neurologische Langzeitergebnis 2,5 bis 5 Jahre nach dem Reanimationsereignis sowie den Zusammenhang zwischen Behandlungsergebnis und präklinischen Patienten- und Behandlungsfaktoren. Methodik Alle über einen Zeitraum von 30 Monaten (2011–2013) durch den Rettungsdienst der Stadt Bonn durchgeführten Reanimationen wurden auf Grundlage der Notarzteinsatzprotokolle und des Deutschen Reanimationsregisters retrospektiv analysiert. Der allgemeine Gesundheitszustand wurde in Anlehnung an den SF-12 erfasst und das neurologische Langzeitergebnis kategorisiert ( Cerebral Performance Category [CPC]). Die vorliegenden Daten wurden einer uni- und multivariaten logistischen Regressionsanalyse unterzogen. Ergebnis Von insgesamt 458 Patienten überlebten 17,9 % bis zur Krankenhausentlassung, 13,8 % mehr als 2,5 Jahre und 7,7 % bis zum Stichtag der Befragung. Von den noch lebenden Patienten hatten 85,3 % ein gutes neurologisches Ergebnis (CPC ≤ 2), welches durch ein geringeres Alter, einen beobachteten Kollaps, die Durchführung einer Defibrillation und das Ausbleiben einer Vasopressorgabe begünstigt wurde (multivariate Analyse). 74,2 % der Überlebenden beschrieben ihren Gesundheitszustand als gut. Interpretation Insgesamt überleben langfristig nur wenige Patienten einen außerklinischen Herz-Kreislauf-Stillstand. Die überlebenden Patienten beurteilen ihren Gesundheitszustand als gut und zeigen ein gutes neurologisches Ergebnis. Dabei hängt dieses Behandlungsergebnis von denselben Parametern wie der primäre Reanimationserfolg (Überleben bis Krankenhausaufnahme) ab. Die Etablierung klinischer Instrumente zur frühen Prognoseerstellung ist wünschenswert. Hierzu sind weitere Langzeituntersuchungen größerer Patientenkollektive mit Zugriff auf Routinedaten notwendig.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term functional and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors stratified by initial defibrillation provider.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included adult non-traumatic OHCA with initial shockable rhythms between 2010 and 2019. Survivors at 12 months after arrest were invited to participate in structured telephone interviews. Outcomes were identified using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey and living and work status-related questions.\nRESULTS: 6050 patients had initial shockable rhythms, 3211 (53.1%) had a pulse on hospital arrival, while 1879 (31.1%) were discharged alive. Bystander defibrillation using the closest automated external defibrillator had the highest survival rate (52.8%), followed by dispatched first responders (36.7%) and paramedics (27.9%). 1802 (29.8%) patients survived to 12-month postarrest; of these 1520 (84.4%) were interviewed. 1088 (71.6%) were initially shocked by paramedics, 271 (17.8%) by first responders and 161 (10.6%) by bystanders. Bystander-shocked survivors reported higher rates of living at home without care (87.5%, 75.2%, 77.0%, p<0.001), upper good recovery (GOS-E=8) (41.7%, 30.4%, 30.6%, p=0.002) and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) ≥80 (64.9%, 55.9%, 52.9%, p=0.003) compared with first responder and paramedics, respectively. After adjustment, initial bystander defibrillation was associated with higher odds of EQ-5D VAS ≥80 (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10; p=0.004), good functional recovery (GOS-E ≥7) (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.11; p=0.009), living at home without care (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.16-2.71; p=0.009) and returning to work (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.81; p=0.031) compared with paramedic defibrillation.\nCONCLUSION: Survivors receiving initial bystander defibrillation reported better functional and HRQoL outcomes at 12 months after arrest compared with those initially defibrillated by paramedics.",

    "abstract": "Comatose survivors of cardiac arrest may die following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) due to poor neurologic prognosis. Family members, acting as surrogate decision makers, are frequently asked to decide whether the patient should continue to receive ongoing life-sustaining therapy such as mechanical ventilation in this context of risk of death following removal. Sometimes, physicians and family members disagree about what is in the patient's best interest, and this conflict causes distress for both families and medical personnel.This article examines themes recorded in the medical records of 24 cardiac arrest patients at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) whose families chose to pursue continued life support despite physician recommendations for withdrawal. In documented conversations between patients' families and their providers, the most prominent themes included faith in miracles, the inappropriateness of \"playing God,\" the value of more time with the patient, and differences in how providers and family members perceived the patient's status.",

We assessed their preferences toward needs during hospitalization and beyond to inform intervention development.\nMETHODS: Through an online survey developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, cardiac arrest survivors, and families, adult close family members recruited through advocacy organizations ranked top choice among 8 unique interventions addressing either information-based needs (n = 4) or well-being needs (n = 4). Logistic Regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations of family members' attributes, caregiving characteristics, and survivors' hospitalization factors with two intervention groups.\nRESULTS: Of 657 responses received, ranking data of 550 close family members (59% between 18-40 years of age, 65% female, 51% of minority race/ethnicity, 53% partners, provided a median of 8 hours of caregiving, for a median of 4.5 months) were analyzed. Information needs were the more commonly preferred intervention group (63%; n = 347), with education on the potential recovery of survivors ranking first (28%; n = 149). In a multivariate model, family members age >40 years, families witnessing the cardiac arrest, assuming the caregiver role either during hospitalization or within one month of hospital discharge, and discharging directly to home were significantly associated with prioritizing information needs over well-being needs, after adjusting for sex, race, intensity, and duration of caregiving.\nCONCLUSIONS: Interventions focusing on information needs are among the top priorities for families of cardiac arrest survivors. Prospective studies testing these hypotheses-generating findings are needed to inform further intervention development.",

Data collection and analysis using the seven stages of hermeneutic analysis described by Diekelman. Data were collected through semi-structured personal interviews with open-ended questions.\nRESULTS: Analysis revealed five themes: 'The unexpected attack', 'Experiencing a different world: Transformation of Body, Time, Emotion and Sensation', 'Restoration of the re-embodied self', 'Life transformation' and 'Personal transformation'. The themes are commensurate with transcultural components of Near-Death Experiences. Surviving out of hospital cardiac arrest was perceived as a 'divine gift' and a chance to continue 'living in a more conscious and meaningful way'. Despite participants' physical and psychosocial challenges, the narratives highlighted a newly acquired deep appreciation for the joy of life, living and others. Construction of meaning and a heightened spirituality seem central in reconstructing life after out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors reflected and described in-depth on their lived experiences of out of hospital cardiac arrest through a 60- to 90-min interview. In addition, the participants provided their feedback on the interpretation of the findings, confirmed the study findings, and ensured that the analysis reflected aspects of their individual experiences and were true to them.",

However, it is often not provided, even by people who have previously undertaken training. Psychological and behavioural factors are likely to be important in relation to CPR initiation by lay-people but have not yet been systematically identified.\nMETHODS: Aim: to identify the psychological and behavioural factors associated with CPR initiation amongst lay-people.\nDESIGN: Systematic review Data sources: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Google Scholar.\nSTUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Primary studies reporting psychological or behavioural factors and data on CPR initiation involving lay-people published (inception to 31 Dec 2021).\nSTUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Potential studies were screened independently by two reviewers. Study characteristics, psychological and behavioural factors associated with CPR initiation were extracted from included studies, categorised by study type and synthesised narratively.\nRESULTS: One hundred and five studies (150,820 participants) comprising various designs, populations and of mostly weak quality were identified. The strongest and most ecologically valid studies identified factors associated with CPR initiation: the overwhelming emotion of the situation, perceptions of capability, uncertainty about when CPR is appropriate, feeling unprepared and fear of doing harm. Current evidence comprises mainly atheoretical cross-sectional surveys using unvalidated measures with relatively little formal testing of relationships between proposed variables and CPR initiation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preparing people to manage strong emotions and increasing their perceptions of capability are likely important foci for interventions aiming to increase CPR initiation. The literature in this area would benefit from more robust study designs.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42018117438.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) survivors experience continuous exposures to potential traumas though chronic cognitive, physical and emotional sequelae and enduring somatic threats (ESTs) (i.e., recurring somatic traumatic reminders of the event). Sources of ESTs can include the daily sensation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), ICD-delivered shocks, pain from rescue compressions, fatigue, weakness, and changes in physical function. Mindfulness, defined as non-judgmental present-moment awareness, is a teachable skill that might help CA survivors cope with ESTs. Here we describe the severity of ESTs in a sample of long-term CA survivors and explore the cross-sectional relationship between mindfulness and severity of ESTs.\nMETHODS: We analyzed survey data of long-term CA survivors who were members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation (collected 10-11/2020). We assessed ESTs using 4 cardiac threat items from the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-revised (items range from 0 \"very little\" to 4 \"very much\") which we summed to create a score reflecting total EST burden (range 0-16). We assessed mindfulness using the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised. First, we summarized the distribution of EST scores. Second, we used linear regression to describe the relationship between mindfulness and EST severity adjusting for age, gender, time since arrest, COVID-19-related stress, and loss of income due to COVID.\nRESULTS: We included 145 CA survivors (mean age: 51 years, 52% male, 93.8% white, mean time since arrest: 6 years, 24.1% scored in the upper quarter of EST severity). Greater mindfulness (β: -30, p = 0.002), older age (β: -0.30, p = 0.01) and longer time since CA (β: -0.23, p = 0.005) were associated with lower EST severity. Male sex was also associated with greater EST severity (β: 0.21, p = 0.009).\nCONCLUSION: ESTs are common among CA survivors. Mindfulness may be a protective skill that CA survivors use to cope with ESTs. Future psychosocial interventions for the CA population should consider using mindfulness as a core skill to reduce ESTs.",

We aimed to describe and compare the use of healthcare by OHCA survivors two years before and one year after cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: Adult patients with OHCA of medical cause, who survived >30 days, were identified in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry. The Norwegian Patient Registry, The Cause of Death Registry, and The Norwegian Registry for Primary Healthcare provided data on survival and the use of healthcare services. We investigated the use of primary, specialist and mental healthcare, as well as rehabilitation services.\nRESULTS: In 2015-2018, 13,112 OHCA cases were identified; 1435 (14%) patients survived >30 days (6.8/100,000 patients/year). The proportion of patients in the cohort that used primary healthcare each month increased form 43% before to 69% after OHCA to (p < 0.001). We found a doubling of monthly healthcare contacts in specialist healthcare (from 26% to 57%, p < 0.001) and yearly contacts for mental healthcare (from 3% to 8%, p > 0.001). The observed increases in primary, specialist and mental healthcare use started two weeks, six months, and eight months before OHCA, respectively. Half of the patients had contact with primary healthcare services on the same day as the cardiac arrest. Two out of five patients were registered for rehabilitation after OHCA.\nCONCLUSION: The use of primary, specialist and mental healthcare services increased before OHCA and remained significantly higher the year after OHCA. Less than half of the patients surviving cardiac arrest were registered for rehabilitation.",

While basic life support courses prepare participants to provide CPR, the courses rarely address the possibility of meeting a family member or relative in crisis. This study aimed to examine volunteer responders' provision of support to relatives of cardiac arrest patients and how relatives experienced the interaction with volunteer responders.\nDESIGN: In this qualitative study, we conducted 16 semistructured interviews with volunteer responders and relatives of cardiac arrest patients.\nSETTING: Interviews were conducted face to face and by video and recorded and transcribed verbatim.\nPARTICIPANTS: Volunteer responders dispatched to cardiac arrests and relatives of cardiac arrest patients were included in the study. Participants were included from all five regions of Denmark.\nRESULTS: A thematic analysis was performed with inspiration from Braun and Clarke. We identified three themes: (1) relatives' experiences of immediate relief at arrival of assistance, (2) volunteer responders' assessment of relatives' needs and (3) the advantage of being healthcare educated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Relatives to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients benefited from volunteer responders' presence and support and experienced the mere presence of volunteer responders as supportive. Healthcare-educated volunteer responders felt confident and skilled to provide care for relatives, while some non-healthcare-educated volunteer responders felt they lacked the proper training and knowledge to provide emotional support for relatives. Future basic life support courses should include a lesson on how to provide emotional support to relatives of cardiac arrest patients.",

We conducted a systematic review and a meta-synthesis to understand family experiences and care needs during cardiac arrest care to create treatment recommendations.\nMETHODS: We searched eight electronic databases to identify articles. Study findings were extracted, coded and synthesized. Confidence in the quality, coherence, relevance, and adequacy of data underpinning the resulting findings was assessed using GRADE-CERQual methods.\nRESULTS: In total 4181 studies were screened, and 39 met our inclusion criteria; these studies enrolled 215 survivors and 418 family participants-which includes both co-survivors and bereaved family members. From these studies findings and participant data we identified 5 major analytical themes: (1) When the crisis begins we must respond; (2) Anguish from uncertainty, we need to understand; (3) Partnering in care, we have much to offer; (4) The crisis surrounding the victim, ignore us, the family, no longer; (5) Our family's emergency is not over, now is when we need help the most. Confidence in the evidence statements are provided along with our review findings.\nDISCUSSION: The family experience of cardiac arrest care is often chaotic, distressing, complex and the aftereffects are long-lasting. Patient and family experiences could be improved for many people. High certainty family care needs identified in this review include rapid recognition and response, improved information sharing, more effective communication, supported presence and participation, or supported absence, and psychological aftercare.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current measures of health-related quality of life are neither sufficiently sensitive or specific to capture the complex and heterogenous nature of the recovery and survivorship associated with cardiac arrest. To address this critical practice gap, we plan a mixed-methods study to co-produce and evaluate a new cardiac arrest-specific patient/survivor-reported outcome measure (PROM).\nMETHODS: International guidelines have informed a two-stage, iterative, and interactive process.Stage one will establish what is important to measure following cardiac arrest. A meta-ethnography of published qualitative research and a qualitative exploration of the experiences of survivors and their key supporters will inform the development of a measurement framework. This will be supplemented by existing, extensive reviews describing concepts that have previously been measured in this population. Focus groups with survivors, key supporters, and healthcare professionals, followed by further interviews with survivors and key supporters, will inform the iterative refinement of the framework, candidate items, and PROM structure.Stage two will involve a psychometric evaluation following completion by a large cohort of survivors. Measurement theory will inform: the identification of items that best measure important outcomes; item reduction; and provide robust evidence of measurement and practical properties.\nDISCUSSION: An international, collaborative approach to PROM development will engage survivors, key supporters, researchers, and health professionals from study commencement. Successful co-production of the cardiac arrest survivorship and health-related quality of life (CASHQoL) measure will provide a robust, relevant, and internationally applicable measure, suitable for completion by adult survivors, and integration into research, registries, and routine care settings.Ethical approval: University of Warwick Biomedical & Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 22/20-21 granted 10/11/20).",

Many children experience long-term cognitive impairment, including deficits in attention, language, memory, and executive functioning. Deficits in adaptive behavior, such as motor functioning, communication, and daily living skills, have also been reported. These children have a wide range of neurological outcomes, with some experiencing specific deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, and sensorimotor deficits. Some children may experience emotional and psychological difficulties, although many do not, and more research is needed in this area. The burden of pediatric cardiac arrest on the child's family and caregivers can be substantial. This narrative review summarizes current research regarding the cognitive and psychological outcomes following pediatric cardiac arrest, identifies areas for future research, and discusses the needs of these children for rehabilitation services and academic accommodations.",

Hence, we investigated these problems in survivors 1-5 years post-OHCA and whether the results are different at different time points post-OHCA.\nMETHODS: All adults who survived an OHCA in Denmark from 2016 to 2019 were identified using the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry and invited to participate in a survey between October 2020 and March 2021. The survey included the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, \"Two simple questions\" (everyday activities and mental recovery), and the 12-item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. To investigate results at different time points, survivors were divided into four time-groups (12-24, 25-36, 37-48 and 49-56 months post-OHCA). Differences between time-groups were determined using the Kruskall-Wallis test for the mean scores and Chi-square test for the proportion of survivors with symptoms.\nRESULTS: Total eligible survey population was 2116, of which 1258 survivors (60 %) responded. Overall, 29 % of survivors reported fatigue, 20 % anxiety, 15 % depression, and 27 % disability. When survivors were sub-divided by time since OHCA, no significant difference was found on either means scores or proportion between time groups (p = 0.28 to 0.88).\nCONCLUSION: Up to a third of survivors report fatigue, anxiety, depression, reduced mental function and disability 1-5 years after OHCA. This proportion is the same regardless of how much time has passed supporting early screening and tailored post-OHCA interventions to help survivors adapt to their new situation.",

Danish medical registries were used to identify all patients with a first-time diagnosis of cardiac arrest and 2 matched comparison cohorts. The first comparison cohort included patients with a first-time diagnosis of myocardial infarction; the second comprised people from the general population. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021.\nEXPOSURES: In-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Neurologic and psychiatric outcomes after hospital discharge were ascertained using medical registries. Twenty-one-year hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were computed based on Cox regression analysis, controlled for matching factors, and adjusted for comorbidity and socioeconomic status.\nRESULTS: Among the 250 838 individuals included in this study (median age, 67 years [IQR, 57-76 years]; 173 946 [69.3%] male), 3 groups were identified: 12 046 patients with cardiac arrest, 118 332 patients with myocardial infarction, and 120 460 people from the general population. Compared with patients with myocardial infarction, patients with cardiac arrest had an increased rate of ischemic stroke (10 per 1000 persons; HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02-1.64) and hemorrhagic stroke (2 per 1000 persons; HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.12-3.67) in the first year after discharge. During the full follow-up period, rates were as follows: for epilepsy, 28 per 1000 persons (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66-2.44); for dementia, 73 per 1000 persons (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38); for mood disorders including depression, 270 per 1000 persons (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.68-1.89); and for anxiety, 187 per 1000 persons (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.85-2.12). The rate of Parkinson disease was similar in the 2 cohorts (8 per 1000 persons; HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65-1.42). The rates of the aforementioned outcomes were highest during the first year after cardiac arrest and then declined over time. Comparisons between the cohort of patients with cardiac arrest and the general population cohort showed higher rates of epilepsy, dementia, depression, and anxiety in the cardiac arrest group.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, patients discharged after cardiac arrest had an increased rate of subsequent stroke, epilepsy, dementia, depression, and anxiety compared with patients with myocardial infarction and people from the general population, with declining rates over time. These findings suggest the need for preventive strategies and close follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors.",

Inclusion criteria were SCA survivors aged 18-50 years old who reported at least five hours of exercise/week prior to SCA, or who suffered SCA during or ≤60 min after exercise.\nRESULTS: 18 interviews were performed (4 females), age range 19-49 years old. Analysis identified the themes [1] neglected warning signs, [2] fluctuating between gratitude and criticism and [3] one size does not fit all. When young exercisers experienced symptoms such as fainting, chest pain, arrythmia, shortness of breath and fatigue, these were often ignored by either the participants, healthcare personnel or both. SCA survivors were grateful to the healthcare system and for the efforts made by healthcare personnel, but experienced a mismatch between what patients needed and could utilize, and what they actually received regarding both information and individualised services. Being young exercisers, the participants reported to have individual needs, but treatment and rehabilitation were not adapted and were mainly targeted to rehabilitation of older patients.\nCONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare personnel should be aware of cardiac related symptoms and warning signs for SCA, and these should be properly assessed in the population of young exercisers. SCA survivors need useful and repeated information. The needs of SCA survivors among young exercisers require individualisation of services.",

Demographic data and measures of prolonged grief (Prolonged Grief Disorder-13), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), posttraumatic stress (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5), and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) were analyzed using Spearman's correlations ( r s ) as well as univariate and multiple linear regression analyses.\nRESULTS: In total, 108 family members participated. Significant associations between symptoms of prolonged grief, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress were identified ( r s = 0.69-0.79, P < .001). Offered, sought, and/or received professional support from healthcare, lower levels of perceived social support, being a spouse of the deceased, female sex, younger age, and family presence during resuscitation were significantly associated with higher symptom levels of prolonged grief, anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that family members with higher levels of symptoms were offered, sought, and/or received professional support. However, because a minority are offered professional support after deaths from cardiac arrest, future interventions need to proactively identify family members in need of support. Furthermore, perceived social support seems to be an important factor for family members of persons who died from cardiac arrest.",

Three databases (Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE) were searched from inception to 10/05/2022. Two investigators screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The synthesis approach was guided by Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines and a narrative synthesis method.\nRESULTS: The search retrieved 9,459 citations of which 31 were included: 18 quantitative studies (including two RCTs), 12 qualitative studies, and one mixed methods study. The evidence was of very low or low certainty. There were four major findings. High-certainty evidence regarding the effect of family presence during resuscitation on patient outcomes is lacking. Family members had mixed outcomes in terms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and experience of witnessing resuscitation. Provider experience was variable and resuscitation setting, provider education, and provider experience were major influences on family presence during resuscitation. Finally, providers reported that a family support person and organisational guidelines were important for facilitating family presence during resuscitation.\nCONCLUSION: The effect of family presence during resuscitation varies between individuals. There was variability in the effect of family presence during resuscitation on patient outcomes, family and provider outcomes and perceptions.",

Despite medical progress, survival rates with good neurological outcome remain low. For many important clinical issues, no or only insufficient evidence from randomised trials is available. Therefore, a systemic and standardised acquisition of the treatment course and of the outcome of OHCA patients is warranted.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The German Cardiac Arrest Registry (G-CAR) is an observational, prospective, multicentre registry. It will determine the characteristics, initial treatment strategies, invasive procedures, revascularisation therapies and the use of mechanical circulatory support devices with a focus on extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A special feature is the prospective 12-month follow-up evaluating mortality, neurological outcomes and several patient-reported outcomes in the psychosocial domain (health-related quality of life, cognitive impairment, depression/anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and social reintegration). In a pilot phase of 24 months, 15 centres will include approximately 400 consecutive OHCA patients ≥ 18 years. Parallel to and after the pilot phase, scaling up of G-CAR to a national level is envisaged.\nCONCLUSION: G-CAR is the first national registry including a long-term follow-up for adult OHCA patients. Primary aim is a better understanding of the determinants of acute and long-term outcomes with the perspective of an optimised treatment.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: NCT05142124.

The aim was to describe longitudinal variations in grief reactions and its association with professional and social support among bereaved family members after a close person's death from sudden CA.\nMETHODS: This longitudinal multimethod survey included 69 bereaved family members who completed a questionnaire 6 and 12-months after the CA, including the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Qualitative data were collected by open-ended questions. Quantitative data was analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression analysis while written comments were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.\nRESULTS: The median age was 62 years, 67 % were women, and 38 % had been present during the resuscitation attempts. Using the cut-off scores at the 6- and 12-month assessments respectively, 14 % and 17 % reported symptoms of prolonged grief, 32 % and 26 % symptoms of anxiety, 14 % and 9 % depression, and 4 % and 1 % posttraumatic stress. Professional and social support at the 6-month assessment were significantly associated with symptoms of prolonged grief, anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress at the 12-month assessments but could not predict any changes in the grief reactions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Family members' grief reactions point to the importance of proactive and available support over time to meet family members' needs.",

The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.\nMETHODS: Patients aged ≥ 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\nRESULTS: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, respectively, p-value < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and poorer general health.",

We aimed to quantify long-term survival and the annual disease burden of OHCA within a national multi-ethnic Asian cohort.\nMETHODS: We conducted an open cohort study linking the Singapore Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) and the Singapore Registry of Births and Deaths from 2010 to 2019. We performed Cox regression, constructed Kaplan-Meier curves, and calculated DALYs and standardised mortality ratios (SMR) for each year of follow-up.\nRESULTS: We analysed 802 cases. The mean age was 56.0 (SD 17.8). Most were male (631 cases, 78,7%) and of Chinese ethnicity (552 cases, 68.8%). At one year, the SMR was 14.9 (95% CI:12.5-17.8), decreasing to 1.2 (95% CI:0.7-1.8) at three years, and 0.4 (95% CI:0.2-0.8) at five years. Age at arrest (HR:1.03, 95% CI:1.02-1.04, p < 0.001), shockable presenting rhythm (HR:0.75, 95% CI:0.52-0.93, p = 0.015) and CPC category (HR:4.62, 95% CI:3.17-6.75, p < 0.001) were independently associated with mortality. Annual DALYs due to OHCA varied from 304.1 in 2010 to 849.7 in 2015, then 547.1 in 2018. Mean DALYs decreased from 12.162 in 2010 to 3.599 in 2018.\nCONCLUSIONS: OHCA survivors had an increased mortality rate for the first three years which subsequently normalised compared to that of the general population. Annual OHCA disease burden in DALY trended downwards from 2010 to 2018. Improved surveillance and OHCA treatment strategies may improve long-term survivorship and decrease its global burden.\nFUNDING: National Medical Research Council, Singapore, under the Clinician Scientist Award (NMRC/CSA-SI/0014/2017) and the Singapore Translational Research Investigator Award (MOH-000982-01).",

However, data on the disability level and long-term survivorship in such patients are limited. We aimed to determine the long-term disability level, including disability type and severity, in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 1 month after discharge. This nationwide observational study used data from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. We included adult OHCA patients who presented to the emergency departments (ED) of all hospitals in Korea between 2009 and 2018. The main outcome was disability level between 1 month after discharge and the 2-year follow-up. The average disability level was divided into six grades: most severe (grade 1) to mild (grade 6). Among 224,520 OHCA patients, 25,598 (11.4%) survived at 30 days. After excluding 3143 patients with a follow-up less than 2 years, 22,455 patients were included. Newly-developed disabilities were observed in 2664 patients (11.9%) and were more frequent in 1-year survivors than non-survivors (16.7% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.01). The most common type of disability was encephalopathic (54.2%), followed by renal (16.1%), physical (10.5%), and cardiac (4.2%) disabilities. Grade 1 disability was most frequent, followed by grade 2 and 3 (45.7%, 23.5%, 10.9%, respectively). Among patients who survived at 30 days after OHCA, 11.9% developed disabilities, including encephalopathic, physical, renal, and cardiac disabilities. Physicians should be aware of the risk of these disabilities and efforts to treat these disabilities in OHCA survivors should be increased.",

Hospital readmission was reported by 23 of 37 patients (62.2%) at 6 months and 16 of 33 (48.5%) at 12 months. Less than half of previously working participants had returned to work by 12 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest survivors had a good functional outcome and health-related quality of life at 6 months, and this was largely unchanged at 12 months. Despite this, many reported problems with mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression. Return to work rates was low, and hospital readmissions were common.",

Among hospital-discharge survivors, the 3-year end point of mortality or mortality and all-cause readmission was examined with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression model for predictors. The use of publicly funded home care and community services within 1 year after discharge also was evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of the 10,674 linked, emergency medical services-treated adult OHCAs, 3230 were admitted to hospital and 1325 survived to hospital discharge. At 3 years after discharge, the estimated Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 84.1% (95% CI 81.7%-86.1%) and freedom from death or all-cause readmission was 31.8% (29.0%-34.7%). After exclusions, 26.6% (n = 315/1186) accessed residential or home care services within 1 year. Independent predictors of long-term outcomes included age and comorbidities, but also favourable arrest characteristics and in-hospital factors such as revascularization or receipt of an intracardiac defibrillator before discharge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among OHCA hospital survivors, the long-term death or readmission risk persists and is modulated by both pre- and in-hospital factors. However, only 1 in 4 survivors required residential or home care after discharge. These results support efforts to improve care processes to increase survival to hospital discharge.",

Embase, Medline, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 6, 2021. Studies were included if they reported outcomes at 1 year or beyond after pediatric OHCA. Data abstraction and quality assessment was conducted by three authors independently. Qualitative outcomes were reported systematically. Seven studies were included, and amongst patients that survived to hospital discharge or to 30 days, longer-term survival was at least 95% at 24 months of follow up. A highly variable proportion (range 10-71%) of patients had favorable neurological outcomes at 24 months of follow up. With regard to health-related quality of life outcomes, at a time point distal to 1 year, at least 60% of pediatric non-traumatic OHCA patients were reported to have good outcomes. Our study found that at least 95% of pediatric OHCA patients, who survived to discharge, survived to a time point distal to 1 year.

Little is known about long-term outcomes and resource use among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: In this observationsl study, we describe overall long-term outcomes for patients from the national Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival linked to Medicare files to create the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival: Mortality, Events, and Costs for Cardiac Arrest survivors dataset. Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival data between 2013 and 2019 were linked to Medicare data using probabilistic matching algorithms. Overall long-term mortality, readmissions, and index hospitalization costs are reported for the overall cohort.\nRESULTS: Among 56 425 patients who were 65 years of age or older in Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival who survived to hospital admission, 26 875 (47.6%) were successfully linked to Medicare files. Mean (SD) cost of the index hospitalization was $23 262$24 199 and the median cost was $14 636 (interquartile range, $9930-$30 033). Overall, 8676 (32.3%) survived to hospital discharge with 38.0% discharged home, 11.8% to hospice care, and the remaining 50.2% to other inpatient, skilled nursing care, or rehabilitation facilities. Mortality after discharge was initially high (27.0% at 3 months) and then increased gradually, with 1- and 3-year mortality of 37.1% and 50.1%, respectively. During the first year, 40.1% were readmitted at least once, with 19.7% readmitted on > 1 occasion.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival: Mortality, Events, and Costs for Cardiac Arrest survivors registry includes rich data on postdischarge outcomes and resource utilization. Use of this dataset will enable future investigations on the long-term effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of various interventions for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Few studies have focused on mid/long-term neurological changes in out-of- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Some studies suggest that there is still a slow, small, progressive improvement in cognitive function and quality of life for this population, even in the mid/long term. However, clinical data focused on mid/long-term outcomes for OHCA patients are still lacking. This study aimed to assess mid-term neurological changes in OHCA patients. We summarized patients' improved or worsened neurological changes between 30 and 90 days. Then we identified the relationship between clinical variables and 30- to 90-day neurological improvement.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of data (Jun 2014 - Dec 2017) from a Japanese nationwide OHCA registry was conducted. Inclusion criteria were OHCA patients ≥18 years old. Exclusion criteria were death within 30 days and missing Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 30 and 90 days. We described the distributions of 30-day and 90-day CPC scores as well as the number and portion of patients whose CPC scores improved and worsened between 30 and 90 days. Additionally, factors affecting improved neurological changes over the time period were examined using multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of the registry's 34,745 patients, 1868 were analyzed. Favorable neurological outcomes (CPC scores of 1 and 2) were seen in 1020/1868 patients at 90 days. CPC scores at 90 days were: CPC 1: 866 (46%), CPC 2: 154 (8.2%), CPC 3: 224 (12%), and CPC 4: 392 (20%), respectively. A total of 232 patients (CPC 5: 12%) died between 30 and 90 days. In 133 patients (7%), 90-day CPC scores improved compared to their 30-day scores. In 260 patients (14%), 90-day CPC scores worsened compared with their 30-day scores. Application of target temperature management was an independent factor for 30- to 90-day neurological improvement (adjusted odds ratio: 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.68).\nCONCLUSIONS: In our nationwide registry, 7% of resuscitated patients had improved neurological changes in the 30- to 90-day period; most of the improvements were CPC scores improving from 2 to 1. Target temperature management was an independent factor associated with CPC improvement over the 30- to 90-day period.",

In this longitudinal survey study, we evaluated associations between mindfulness, baseline psychological symptoms, and 1-year psychological symptoms in long-term CA survivors. We collected demographic and CA characteristics at baseline. At both timepoints, we assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) through the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) and depression and anxiety symptoms through the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). At follow-up, we assessed mindfulness through the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R). We used adjusted linear regression to predict 1-year PCL-5 and PHQ-4 scores, with particular consideration of the CAMS-R as a cross-sectional correlate of outcome. We included 129 CA survivors (mean age: 52 years, 52% male, 98% white). At 1-year follow-up, in adjusted models, CAMS-R (β: -0.35, p < 0.001) and baseline PCL-5 scores (β: 0.56, p < 0.001) were associated with 1-year PCL-5 scores. CAMS-R (β: -0.34, p < 0.001) and baseline PHQ-4 scores were associated with 1-year PHQ-4 scores (β: 0.37, p < 0.001). In conclusion, mindfulness was inversely associated with psychological symptoms in long-term CA survivors. Future studies should examine the longitudinal relationship of mindfulness and psychological symptoms after CA.",

Cardiac arrest survivors and their relatives were engaged in PPIE to help develop the methods of a research study that aims to reduce individual and care process variation during paramedic-led resuscitation.\nMETHODS: This research methodology paper represents the views of seven PPIE representatives and the authors. PPIE representatives included five cardiac arrest survivors and two relatives. Content for the paper was generated by discussion using audio or video call. Notes were taken by the author which included direct quotations generated by the PPIE process.\nRESULTS: The PPIE representatives considered research surrounding the decisions made by paramedics to be important. From their first-hand experiences, survivors and their relatives felt that a future research study should focus on patient survival. The decision-making of paramedics was identified as most important to explore. Quality of life before the cardiac arrest was considered important as this may help to inform best-interest decisions. The neurologic recovery of patients was important; however, rehabilitation may be extensive and therefore unachievable within the study timeframe. Relatives highlighted that while incorporating their views during resuscitation was important, gaining consent for research participation was not appropriate.\nCONCLUSION: PPIE added value and helped to develop a future study to reduce variation in the resuscitation decisions made by paramedics. The group identified what is important to survivors and their relatives and the factors they would like paramedics to consider when making a resuscitation decision. By identifying these factors, the PPIE process has helped to drive the research methods where both quantitative and qualitative designs would be appropriate. Issues in gaining research consent during resuscitation were highlighted.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Intensive care unit patients are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which includes psychological, physical and/or cognitive sequelae after their hospital stay. Our aim was to investigate PICS in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, we assessed risks for PICS at 3 and 12-month follow-up within the following domains: a) physical impairment (EuroQol [EQ-5D-3L]), b) cognitive functioning (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] score >1, modified Rankin Scale [mRS] >2) and c) psychological burden (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]).\nRESULTS: At 3 months, 69/139 patients (50%) met the definition of PICS including 37% in the physical domain, 25% in the cognitive domain and 13% in the psychological domain. Intubation (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.1 to 5,0 p = 0.03), sedatives (OR 3.4, 95%CI 1 to 11, p = 0.045), mRS at discharge (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.70 to 11.01, p = 0.002), CPC at discharge (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.4 to 7.6, p = 0.005) and post-discharge work loss (OR 13.4, 95%CI 1.7 to 107.5, p = 0.014) were significantly associated with PICS. At 12 months, 52/110 (47%) patients had PICS, which was associated with prolonged duration of rehabilitation, higher APACHE scores, and higher mRS and CPC scores at hospital discharge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of long-term OHCA survivors show PICS after 3 and 12 months. These high numbers call for more emphasis on appropriate screening and treatment in this patient population. Future studies should evaluate whether early identification of these patients enables preventive strategies and treatment options.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: This study investigated the feasibility and potential effect of SCARF (Survivors of Cardiac ARest focused on Fatigue) a multidisciplinary residential rehabilitation intervention focused on fatigue and the secondary psychological and physical consequences of cardiac arrest (CA).\nMETHODS: This was a prospective one-armed feasibility study. Six progression criteria were identified related to the feasibility of the intervention and viability of a future effect study in terms of: participant recruitment (1), participant retention (2,3,4), and completeness of outcomes (5,6). Data on participant/clinician satisfaction with the intervention was also collected along with self-reported outcomes: fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, depression, function and disability, and physical activity (at baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months) and physical capacity (baseline and 12 weeks).\nRESULTS: Four progression criteria were met including retention (87.5%) and completion of baseline outcomes (97.5%). Two criteria were not met: recruitment rate was 2.9 participants per month (estimated rate needed 6.1) and completion of final outcomes was 65% (estimated proportion needed 75%). Participant/clinician satisfaction with the intervention was high. Three months after the SCARF intervention small to moderate effect size changes of r = 0.18-0.46 were found for self-reported fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, depression, function and disability and for two of the physical capacity tests (d = 0.46-0.52).\nCONCLUSION: SCARF was found to be a feasible intervention with high participant/clinician satisfaction, high participant retention and the possible potential to improve self-reported and physical capacity outcomes. Procedures for study recruitment and collection of final outcomes should be modified before a fully powered randomised controlled trial is conducted.",

    "abstract": "Background Cardiac arrest survivorship refers to the lived experience of long-term survivors of cardiac arrest and the many postdischarge challenges they experience. We aimed to gather a nuanced understanding of these challenges and of survivors' perceptions of ways to improve the recovery process. Methods and Results We conducted 15 semistructured, one-on-one interviews with cardiac arrest survivor members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation; the interviews were conducted by telephone and recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis, informed by the Framework Method, to identify underlying themes regarding cardiac arrest survivorship challenges and recommendations to improve cardiac arrest survivorship. Regarding challenges, the overarching theme was a feeling of unpreparedness to confront postarrest challenges because of lack of resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Regarding recommendations, we uncovered 3 overarching themes including systemic recommendations (eg, providing appropriate resources and expectations, educating providers about survivorship, following up with survivors, including caregivers in treatment planning), social recommendations (eg, attending peer support groups, spending time with loved ones, providing support resources for family members), and individual coping recommendations (eg, acceptance, resilience, regaining control, seeking treatment, focusing on meaning and purpose). Conclusions We described common challenges that survivors of cardiac arrest face, such as lacking resources, education, and appropriate expectations for recovery. Additionally, we identified promising pathways that may improve cardiac arrest survivorship at systemic, social, and individual coping levels. Future studies could use our findings as targets for interventions to support and improve survivorship.",

The studies excluded were those involving the pediatric population (<age 16), written in a language other than English, and studies with no mention of outcomes. The literature search was done by PubMed and EBSCOhost databases from the oldest available literature through November 2019. Due to the scarcity of published literature and a qualitative description of outcomes, a narrative review of the literature was deemed appropriate. Seven case reports and one retrospective cohort study met the inclusion criteria. Cognitive and visual impairments were significant barriers to rehabilitation in CB. Improvement of visual deficits occurred within one to two months. Those with complete blindness, cognitive impairments, and a delay in resuscitation were more likely to have poorer functional outcomes in the performance of activities of daily living and were less likely to be discharged home. This is the most comprehensive review of published literature to focus on the function of patients with cortical blindness. The limitations include the small number of published literature and the qualitative approach utilized. Despite the limitations, the findings of this review can inform future studies that would investigate the most efficient and comprehensive methods of CB rehabilitation.",

At discharge, 60% were on paid sick leave, and 20% at 12 months. Age (per one year older) increased the odds of experiencing the composite endpoint at 3 and 12 months (3 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.10, 12 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.09) among the total population (n = 184). Self-reported health at discharge was not associated with the endpoint.\nCONCLUSION: One-fifth of the OHCA survivors at a working-age prior to the OHCA was still on paid sick leave after 12 months. Increasing age was the only characteristic associated with a composite endpoint of prolonged sick leave or leaving the workforce at 3 and 12 months after discharge. With increasing survival rates, healthcare professionals need to support the population in resuming daily life, including returning to the workforce, when relevant.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia, sleep apnoea and sleep loss are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Most research on sleep disturbances includes patients with heart failure, while the role of sleep in sudden cardiac arrest survivors (SCA) has been only partially investigated and understood. Sleep-related breathing disorders and obstructive sleep apnoea increase illness and mortality in the aftermath of SCA. Also, post-traumatic stress is evident in SCA survivors, where sleep disruptions are some of the main symptoms of the condition. Consequently, it is important to identify sleep problems in SCA survivors at an early stage to avoid unnecessary suffering.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate registered nurses' perceptions of SCA survivors' sleep, both in hospital and after discharge.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was an explorative interview study with a phenomenographic approach. Nineteen registered nurses (RNs) varying in age, sex and years in the profession participated.\nFINDINGS: The nurses' perceptions of SCA survivors' sleep were categorized as: \"The observer - noticing behaviours, emotions and habits of the patient that affect sleep\", \"The oblivious witness - attitudes that hinder the ability to recognise sleep behaviours\", and \"The practitioner - advising and medicating for sleep\". The outcome space showed that the nurses detected both obvious and subtle signs relating to patients' sleep. However, attitudes hindering the recognition of sleep behaviours were independent of acting as an observer or practitioner. If nothing unforeseen was observed, or if the patient did not spontaneously raise the subject, sleep was considered less important than other health problems in SCA survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the nurses knew that SCA survivors suffered from poor sleep, they failed to reflect on the consequences for the patient. Nurses' feelings of insufficient knowledge about sleep, as well as their omittance of sleep in the follow-up documentation could leave sleep issues unaddressed and cause unnecessary patient suffering.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need increased knowledge and training to enable them to detect subtle signs of sleep problems in SCA survivors.",

Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate 30-day and 30-180-day survival. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between covariates and one-year mortality.\nRESULTS: Among 1,015 patients admitted, 698 achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before admission, 101 patients with refractory OHCA received mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and the remaining 216 patients with refractory OHCA did not receive MCS treatment. Survival to hospital discharge was 47% (478/1015). Good neurological outcome defined as Cerebral Performance Categories 1-2 were seen among 92% (438/478) of the patients discharged from hospital. Median low-flow was 15 [8-22] minutes in the ROSC group and 105 [94-123] minutes in the MCS group. Mortality rates were high within the first 30 days, however; 30-180-day survival in patients discharged remained constant over time in both patients with ROSC on admission and patients admitted with MCS. Advanced age > 70 years (hazard ratio (HR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-3.49), pulseless electrical activity (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.25-4.60) and asystole HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.25-5.95) as initial rhythms were associated with one-year mortality in patients with ROSC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Short-term survival rates were high among patients with ROSC and patients receiving MCS. Among patients who survived to day 30, landmark analyses showed comparable 180-day survival in the two groups despite long low-flow times in the MCS group. Advanced age and initial non-shockable rhythms were independent predictors of one-year mortality in patients with ROSC on admission.",

Understanding their experiences provides a basis to study tools and interventions to improve short- and long-term recovery and rehabilitation.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Qualitative interview and survey-style studies explored the lived experience of SCA survivors and revealed common themes (e.g., need for recovery expectations and long-term follow-up resources). A heightened awareness for the unique needs of family and loved ones of survivors led to qualitative studies focusing on these members as well. Methodology papers published portend prospective assessment and follow-up cohort studies. However, no investigations evaluating discharge processes or specific interventions directed at domain impairments common after SCA were identified in the review period. International work continues to identify patient and family-centered priorities for outcome measurement and research.\nSUMMARY: In line with increased recognition of the importance for recovery and rehabilitation after SCA, there has been a commensurate increase in investigations documenting the needs of survivors and families surviving SCA. Pediatric and underserved populations continue to be understudied with regards to recovery after SCA.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic hypothermia minimizes neuronal injury in animal models of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with greater effect when used sooner after the insult. Clinical trials generally showed limited benefit but are difficult to perform in a timely manner. In this clinical study, we evaluated the association between the use of hypothermia (or not) and health-related quality of life among survivors of pediatric cardiac arrest as well as overall mortality.\nDESIGN: Single-center, retrospectively identified cohort with prospective assessment of health-related quality of life.\nSETTING: PICU of a pediatric hospital.\nPATIENTS: Children with either out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest from January 2012 to December 2017.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned into two groups: those who received therapeutic hypothermia at less than or equal to 35°C and those who did not receive therapeutic hypothermia but who had normothermia targeted (36-36.5°C). The primary outcome was health-related quality of life assessment and the secondary outcome was PICU mortality.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied 239 children, 112 (47%) in the therapeutic hypothermia group. The median (interquartile range) of lowest temperature reached in the 48 hours post cardiac arrest in the therapeutic hypothermia group was 33°C (32.6-33.6°C) compared with 35.4°C (34.7-36.2°C) in the no therapeutic hypothermia group (p < 0.001). At follow-up, 152 (64%) were alive and health-related quality of life assessments were completed in 128. Use of therapeutic hypothermia was associated with higher lactate and lower pH at baseline. After regression adjustment, therapeutic hypothermia (as opposed to no therapeutic hypothermia) was associated with higher physical (mean difference, 15.8; 95% CI, 3.5-27.9) and psychosocial scores (13.6 [5.8-21.5]). These observations remained even when patients with a temperature greater than 37.5°C were excluded. We failed to find an association between therapeutic hypothermia and lower mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest treated with therapeutic hypothermia was associated with higher health-related quality of life scores despite having association with higher lactate and lower pH after resuscitation. We failed to identify an association between use of therapeutic hypothermia and lower mortality.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When surviving a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving may be present for months or years. The survivors' family and colleagues are also highly affected by the incident. There is little knowledge about experiences of surviving SCA in individuals who prior to the incident were young and reported to exercise regularly. Consequently, the aim of this study was to explore the aftermath of surviving a SCA in young, regular exercisers.\nMETHODS: The study had a qualitative design, conducting in-depth individual interviews with SCA survivors < 50 years of age reporting to exercise ≥ 5 h/week and/or who suffered SCA during or less than 60 min after exercise. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation in-line with recommendations from Malterud.\nRESULTS: 18 of 31 eligible participants were included in the study. Through analysis we identified 'Establishing a new everyday life' as superordinate category, with subordinate categories a) being part of my surroundings, b) expecting normality but facing a new reality and c) lucky to be alive!\nCONCLUSION: This study adds knowledge about young and regular exercisers' experiences after surviving a SCA. The obligations of everyday life in young survivors of SCA often imply a high work load and complex tasks, e.g. due to being in the beginning of their career or even still studying. Healthcare personnel, as well as the society, need to acknowledge that although lucky to be alive and apparently well-functioning, young survivors of SCA may have persistent challenges that cause frustration and reduced quality of life.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Severe acute brain injury (SABI) from cardiac arrest and traumatic brain injury happens suddenly and unexpectedly, carrying high potential for lifelong disability with substantial prognostic uncertainty. Comprehensive assessments of family experiences and support needs after SABI are lacking. Our objective is to elicit \"on-the-ground\" perspectives about the experiences and needs of families of patients with SABI.\nDESIGN: Two-phase qualitative study of families and multidisciplinary U.S. healthcare professionals (mHCPs) with expertise in SABI: Phase 1 included semistructured interviews to generate formative findings; phase 2 entailed facilitated discussions to confirm and expand initial findings.\nSETTING: Phase 1: academic medical center; phase 2: virtual workshop.\nSUBJECTS: Phase 1 included seven family members and 12 mHCPs. Phase 2 included nationally recruited stakeholders (17 family members and 12 mHCPs).\nINTERVENTION: None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We explored: 1) what are families' needs in the first 48 hours? 2) How are these needs addressed? and 3) How can hospitals better meet these needs? Qualitative analysis included inductive and deductive approaches guided by a conceptual ecological model. Four major needs were identified: 1) challenges in coping with uncertainty in early prognostication, 2) inattention to physical needs of family, 3) deficits in compassionate and consistent communication, and 4) need for engagement with families as stakeholders in improving future practices. Participants' recommendations included: 1) ways to communicate more clearly and consistently, 2) better assistance with navigating resources and access to places for families to care for themselves, and 3) opportunities for families to remain connected with their loved ones, social support networks, and the clinical team.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders identified novel insights regarding families' experiences during the hospitalization of comatose SABI patients and factors that can contribute to improved decision-making and physical/emotional outcomes. Interventions to address these unmet needs are promising targets to improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is critical to increasing survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the percentage of cases in which an individual receives bystander CPR is actually low, at only 35% to 40% globally. Preparing lay responders to recognize the signs of sudden cardiac arrest, call 9-1-1, and perform CPR in public and private locations is crucial to increasing survival from this public health problem. The objective of this scientific statement is to summarize the most recent published evidence about the lay responder experience of training, responding, and dealing with the residual impact of witnessing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The scientific statement focuses on the experience-based literature of actual responders, which includes barriers to responding, experiences of doing CPR, use of an automated external defibrillator, the impact of dispatcher-assisted CPR, and the potential for postevent psychological sequelae. The large body of qualitative and observational studies identifies several gaps in crucial knowledge that, if targeted, could increase the likelihood that those who are trained in CPR will act. We suggest using the experience of actual responders to inform more contextualized training, including the implications of performing CPR on a family member, dispelling myths about harm, training and litigation, and recognition of the potential for psychologic sequelae after the event.",

Identifying factors persistently impacting the quality of life after CA is crucial to improve long-term outcomes.\nMETHODS: Adult in- and out-of-hospital CA patients surviving to hospital discharge between 1996 and 2015 were retrospectively included. We classified survivors in stages of survival time and assessed long-term survival and quality of life by contacting patients via a standardized telephone questionnaire including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).\nRESULTS: Of 4,234 patients, 1,573 (37.2%) survived to hospital discharge. Among those, 693(44.1%) were alive at the time of the interview. We obtained interviews in 178 patients at a survival time of 7.8 (4.2-12.6) years. Younger age, female gender, and shorter duration of initial hospitalization and coma were associated with long-term survival. Conversely, higher median age at time of CA predicted poor outcome (mRS ≥ 3) and impaired quality of daily life. Around 25% declared being impaired in mobility, with female gender and higher age being predictors. Impairment in personal care and hygiene was stated in 11.8%, and activities of daily life such as shopping troubled 33.1%. Chronic pain impairing daily life was reported in 47.2% of cases, and lower socioeconomic status was suggestive of unfavourable outcome.\nCONCLUSION: Very long-term survivors showed considerable impairment of quality of life in terms of reduced mobility, self-care, or chronic pain. Higher age at time of CA and lower socioeconomic status showed worse outcomes. A more personalized screening of survivors for risk factors and long-term support are suggested.",

Data consisted of semistructured interviews with 12 relatives of OHCA survivors. We analyzed data based on Paul Ricoeur's theory of interpretation.\nRESULTS: Relatives experienced OHCA as an abrupt and stressful event filled with imposing concerns for the cardiac arrest survivor. Relatives were fellow sufferers confronted with the possibility of bereavement, watching from the sideline with fearful eyes. After the OHCA, relatives experienced a troubled time with anxiety and edginess, monitoring the survivor for signs of a new cardiac arrest and trying to adapt to a new normality. Relatives' previous identities and positions within their families were disrupted.\nCONCLUSION: Relatives were challenged with the OHCA and the trajectory after it, experiencing a high level of distress and anxiety. Relatives took on an immense responsibility, always watching the survivor for potential symptoms of a new cardiac arrest. The cardiac arrest and the survivor's possible cognitive impairments gave rise to assuming a new authority as a relative. We advocate for a new family approach to relatives, acknowledging relatives' stress and central role in supporting cardiac arrest survivors.",

We sought to interview family members and patients to learn from their experiences and satisfaction with treatment.\nMETHODS: We contacted family members and survivors for all cases treated with ECPR for refractory OHCA at St. Paul's Hospital between January 2014 and July 2018. We performed semi-structured interviews with participants, specifically within the topics of: information sharing (including impressions of an ECPR informational pamphlet), prognostication, organ donation, and perceived value of ECPR. Due to low participant enrolment, we described all interviews in a narrative approach.\nRESULTS: Within the study period, there were 23 OHCAs treated with ECPR; two survivors and three family members agreed to participate. Participants were satisfied with the treatment provided, including information sharing and prognostication. There were mixed opinions about the best method of information-sharing (verbal vs written), as well as the timing of organ donation conversations. All participants believed ECPR for OHCA to be of high value.\nCONCLUSION: Patient's conveyed satisfaction with ECPR treatment, with mixed views on the best information sharing strategy. Further study is needed to define the optimal methods and timing for discussions of organ donation, especially for treatments of with a relatively low likelihood success.",

Accordingly, acute traumatic stress screening is recommended, but its association with later PTSD symptoms has never been addressed in postresuscitation settings.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether acute traumatic stress is associated with PTSD symptoms in patients who have had a cardiac arrest and their partners.\nMETHODS: This multicenter longitudinal study of 141 patients and 97 partners measures acute traumatic stress at 3 weeks and PTSD symptoms at 3 months and 1 year after resuscitation, using the Impact of Event Scale. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between severity of acute traumatic stress and PTSD symptoms and post hoc to explore effects of group (patients/partners), age, and sex on acute traumatic stress severity. We categorized Impact of Event Scale scores higher than 26 at 3 months and 1 year as clinical severe PTSD symptoms .\nRESULTS: Higher acute traumatic stress severity is significantly positively associated with higher PTSD symptom severity at 3 months (patients and partners: P < .001) and 1 year (patients and partners: P < .001) postresuscitation, with the strongest association for women compared with men ( P = .03). Acute traumatic stress was higher in women compared with men across groups ( P = .02). Clinical severe PTSD symptoms were present in 26% to 28% of patients and 45% to 48% of partners.\nCONCLUSION: Experiencing a cardiac arrest may elicit clinical severe PTSD symptoms in patients, but particularly in their partners. Screening patients and partners for acute traumatic stress postresuscitation is warranted to identify those at increased risk of long-term PTSD symptoms.",

Organizational factors of potential importance to service provision were considered: health care region, size of catchment area/population, type of department/municipality and socioeconomic index.\nRESULTS: Response rates for the provision of each core component of cardiac rehabilitation ranged from 64% to 98%. All hospitals and municipalities provided some aspect of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest. Across hospitals, provision of four core components of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was lower compared with post acute myocardial infarction patients: patient education (relative risk (RR) = 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.75)), exercise training (RR = 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.98)), screening for anxiety and depression (RR = 0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) and nutritional counselling RR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.93)). No difference was found in the provision of core components across municipalities. Overall, the provision of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was not affected by organizational factors.\nCONCLUSION: This study indicates a need for future research to inform the development, adoption and implementation of equal access to all components of cardiac rehabilitation for survivors of cardiac arrest in Denmark.",

Participants provided demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models.\nRESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (β: -0.35 to -0.53, p < .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in survivors and informal caregivers. Further study is needed to validate these findings in a larger, representative sample.",

Caregivers of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were used as controls.\nMETHODS: Data were collected from the cognitive substudy of the Targeted Temperature Management-trial. Caregiver burden was assessed with the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview, with scores ≤20 considered as no burden. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF-36v2®, with T-scores 47-53 representing the norm. Cardiac arrest survivors were categorized based on the results from cognitive assessments as having \"no cognitive impairment\" or \"cognitive impairment\".\nRESULTS: Follow-up 6 months post event was performed for caregivers of 272 cardiac arrest survivors and 108 matched myocardial infarction controls, included at an intended ratio of 2:1. In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and controls reported similar caregiver burden. The overall scores for quality of life were within normative levels and similar for caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and control patients. Compared to those with no cognitive impairment, caregivers of cognitively impaired cardiac arrest survivors (n = 126) reported higher levels of burden (median 18 versus 8, p < 0.001) and worse quality of life in five of eight domains, particularly \"Role-Emotional\" (mean 45.7 versus 49.5, p = 0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and myocardial infarction controls reported similar levels of burden and quality of life. Cognitive outcome and functional dependency of the cardiac arrest survivor impact burden and quality of life of the caregiver.",

    "abstract": "The smoker’s paradox has been reported to reduce mortality following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, recent studies on this paradox have reported contradictory findings, with some indicating that it does not exist. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between smoking status and OHCA outcomes. This retrospective observational study was conducted using multicenter registry data. The associations between smoking status and OHCA outcomes were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses and propensity score-adjusted methods. We compared outcomes among current, former, and never-smokers, as well as between current and non-smokers and between ever- and never-smokers. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge, and the secondary outcome was favourable neurological outcomes. Among 4443 patients with OHCA, 19.9% were current smokers, 15.2% were former smokers, and 64.9% were never-smokers. Current smokers had significantly better outcomes than former or never-smokers. However, the significant differences observed in univariable analysis or before propensity score matching were not observed after adjustments with multivariable logistic regression or after propensity score matching analysis in both current vs. non-smokers and ever- vs. never-smokers. Other propensity score adjusted models also did not show significant differences, except for the stratification method. This study suggests that smoking is not an independent prognostic factor for OHCA. The statistically significant better outcomes observed in current or ever-smokers were not maintained after adjusting for confounders. Therefore, the smoker’s paradox should be investigated in additional prospective studies.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions on the secondary physical, neurological and psychological consequences of cardiac arrest (CA) for adult survivors.\nMETHODS: A literature search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Psychological Information Database, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials) was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies up to 18 April 2021. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and main secondary outcome was neurological function with additional secondary outcomes being survival, rehospitalisation, safety (serious and non-serious adverse events), psychological well-being, fatigue, exercise capacity and physical capacity. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.\nRESULTS: Three RCTs and 11 observational studies were included (total 721 participants). Study duration ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Pooled data from two RCTs showed low-quality evidence for no effect on physical HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19, (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.47)) and no effect on mental HRQoL (SMD 0.27 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.55)).Regarding secondary outcomes, very low-quality evidence was found for improvement in neurological function associated with inpatient rehabilitation for CA survivors with acquired brain injury (SMD 0.71, (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.96)) from five observational studies. Two small observational studies found exercise-based rehabilitation interventions to be safe for CA survivors, reporting no serious or non-serious events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Given the overall low quality of evidence, this review cannot determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for CA survivors on HRQoL, neurological function or other included outcomes, and recommend further high-quality studies be conducted. In the interim, existing clinical guidelines on rehabilitation provision after CA should be followed to meet the high burden of secondary consequences suffered by CA survivors.\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018110129.",

A systematic review of the literature on family presence during pediatric and neonatal resuscitation has not been previously conducted.\nOBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the published evidence related to family presence during pediatric and neonatal resuscitation.\nDATA SOURCES: Six major bibliographic databases was undertaken with defined search terms and including literature up to June 14, 2020.\nSTUDY SELECTION: 3200 titles were retrieved in the initial search; 36 ultimately included for review.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Data was double extracted independently by two reviewers and confirmed with the review team. All eligible studies were either survey or interview-based and as such we turned to narrative systematic review methodology.\nRESULTS: The authors identified two key sets of findings: first, parents/family members want to be offered the option to be present for their child's resuscitation. Secondly, health care provider attitudes varied widely (ranging from 15% to >85%), however, support for family presence increased with previous experience and level of seniority.\nLIMITATIONS: English language only; lack of randomized control trials; quality of the publications.\nCONCLUSIONS: Parents wish to be offered the opportunity to be present but opinions and perspectives on the family presence vary greatly among health care providers. This topic urgently needs high quality, comparative research to measure the actual impact of family presence on patient, family and staff outcomes.\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020140363.",

To adjust to and manage daily life is critical, and therefore a tailored rehabiliation programme was introduced to the participants. The study aimed to explore the lived experience among cardiac arrest survivors.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Data were gathered through six focus group interviews during a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. Thirty-three out-of-hospital SCA survivors (8 women and 25 men) participated. Time since cardiac arrest was on average 12-57 months. An exploratory qualitative design inspired by Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutics was applied. Two main themes emerged from the analysis and interpretation: (i) a lack of support from the health system in the transition from hospital to daily life; and (ii) feeling understood for the first time. The findings revealed that out-of-hospital SCA survivors experience a knowledge gap struggling for support. Attending the programme, gaining knowledge and experiencing peer support was described as a revelation for them.\nCONCLUSION: The findings suggest that out-of-hospital SCA survivors felt understood for the first time when attending a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. A post-arrest pathway is needed led by a coordinating cardiac arrest specialist nursing service together with allied healthcare professionals. Focus on hypoxic brain injuries, emotional burdens, and supportive strategies are essential in the transition to daily life. Facilitated peer support is warranted.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive and physical difficulties are common in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA); both survivors and close family members are also at risk of developing mood disorders. In the UK, dedicated follow-up pathways for OHCA survivors and their family are lacking. A cohort of survivors and family members were surveyed regarding their experience of post-discharge care and their recommended improvements.\nMETHOD: 123 OHCA survivors and 39 family members completed questionnaires during an educational event or later online. Questions addressed both the actual follow-up offered and the perceived requirements for optimal follow-up from the patient and family perspective, including consideration of timing, professionals involved, involvement of family members and areas they felt should be covered.\nRESULTS: Outpatient follow-up was commonly arranged after OHCA (77%). This was most often conducted by a cardiologist alone (80%) but survivors suggested that other professionals should also be involved (e.g. psychologist/counsellor, 64%). Topics recommended for consideration included cardiac arrest-related issues (heart disease; cause of arrest) mental fatigue/sleep disturbance, cognitive problems, emotional problems and daily activities. Most survivors advocated an early review (<1month; 61%). Most family members reported some psychological difficulties (95%); many of them (95%) advocated a dedicated follow-up appointment for family members of survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: The majority of OHCA survivors advocated an early follow-up following hospital discharge and a holistic, multidimensional assessment of arrest sequelae. These results suggest that current OHCA follow-up often fails to address patient-centred issues and to provide access to professionals deemed important by survivors and family members.",

We conducted an online survey study between October 29, 2019, and November 15, 2019 with cardiac arrest survivors and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. We queried survivors as to whether they experienced cognitive or psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. Next, we queried both survivors and caregivers on the provision of resources through three metrics: (1) discussions with providers about potential cognitive or psychological symptoms, (2) neurologist or psychologist appointments scheduled by providers, and (3) mental health referrals by providers. We then ran Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to compare the proportion of survivors and caregivers who reported resource provision (observed values) to the proportion of survivors who reported experiencing cognitive and psychological symptoms, respectively (expected values). We included responses from 167 survivors and 52 caregivers. A total of 73.1% ( = 122) survivors reported experiencing cognitive symptoms and 67.1% ( = 112) psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. When compared to these two proportions, provision of resources was significantly lower in all three metrics: (1) fewer discussions with providers about potential for developing cognitive symptoms (31%) and psychological symptoms (26.3%), (2) fewer neurologist appointments scheduled (8.4%) and psychologist appointments scheduled (4.8%), and (3) fewer referrals to mental health (6%). Informal caregivers also reported significantly lower provision of resources in all three metrics, with the exception of discussions about developing cognitive symptoms. Our results suggest that there are discrepancies in the provision of cognitive and psychological resources in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery. Systematic referral processes may be needed to standardize resource provision to consistently meet the pervasive cognitive and psychological needs of cardiac arrest survivors.",

Survival rates have increased over the last decade and many survivors return to their communities. IHCA has been recognized as a unique disease entity because the arrest happens in a medical care setting and survivors often have more medical co-morbidities. Although more individuals are surviving IHCA, very little is known about their long-term recovery experiences. Semi-structured interviews with 19 IHCA survivors were conducted to better understand their recovery experiences and identify strategies of adaptation that they felt aided their recovery. Thematic analysis indicated that IHCA survivors experience ongoing challenges to recovery. Reconceptualization of independence was necessary for some participants to re-engage in social and physical activities and a few were able to engage in new activities. Our findings suggest that IHCA survivors often develop their own strategies for adaptation in order to continue participation in their social lives and that their recovery experiences are ongoing. Intervention programs and follow-up care should continuously ask survivors what is important to them and identify resources that will support their goals. Questions should include physical, cognitive, psychological and social goals that extend beyond those specifically related to IHCA since our findings indicate that the effects of IHCA are long-lasting and encompass all aspects of survivors' lives.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Consent for data research in acute and critical care is complex as patients become at least temporarily incapacitated or die. Existing guidelines and regulations in the European Union are of limited help and there is a lack of literature about the use of data from this vulnerable group. To aid the creation of a patient-centred framework for responsible data research in the acute setting, we explored views of patients and next-of-kin about the collection, storage, sharing and use of genetic and health-related data for observational research.\nMETHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews (n = 19) with Dutch sudden cardiac arrest survivors who donated clinical and socio-economic data and genetic samples to research. We also interviewed their next-of-kin. Topics were informed by ethics literature and we used scenario-sketches to aid discussion of complex issues.\nRESULTS: Sudden cardiac arrest survivors displayed limited awareness of their involvement in health data research and of the content of their given consent. We found that preferences regarding disclosure of clinically actionable genetic findings could change over time. When data collection and use were limited to the medical realm, patients trusted researchers to handle data responsibly without concern for privacy or other risks. There was no consensus as to whether deferred consent should be explicitly asked from survivors. If consent is asked, this would ideally be done a few months after the event when cognitive capacities have been regained. Views were divided about the need to obtain proxy consent for research with deceased patients' data. However, there was general support for the disclosure of potentially relevant post-mortem genetic findings to relatives.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sudden cardiac arrest patients' donation of data for research was grounded in trust in medicine overall, blurring the boundary between research and care. Our findings also highlight questions about the acceptability of a one-time consent and about responsibilities of patients, researchers and ethics committees. Finally, further normative investigation is needed regarding the (continued) use of participants' data after death, which is of particular importance in this setting. Our findings are thought to be of relevance for other acute and life-threatening illnesses as well.",

The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nMETHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nRESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5).\nDISCUSSION: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL.",

The purpose of the present paper is to report long-term survival, quality of life, functional and cognitive outcomes at 3, 6 and 12-months.\nMETHODS: PARAMEDIC2 was a pragmatic, individually randomised, double blind, controlled trial with an economic evaluation. Patients were randomised to either adrenaline or placebo. This paper reports results on the modified Rankin Scale scores at 6-months, survival at 6 and 12-months, as well as other cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes collected at 3 and 6 months (Two Simple Questions, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline Evaluation for Cardiac Arrest, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, Short-Form 12-item Health Survey and the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L).\nRESULTS: 8014 patients were randomised with confirmed trial drug administration. At 6-months, 78 (2.0%) of the patients in the adrenaline group and 58 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo group had a favourable neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.97]). 117 (2.9%) patients were alive at 6-months in the adrenaline group compared with 86 (2.2%) in the placebo group (1.43 [1.05, 1.96], reducing to 107 (2.7%) and 80 (2.0%) respectively at 12-months (1.38 [1.00, 1.92]). Measures of 3 and 6-month cognitive, functional and quality of life outcomes were reduced, but there was no strong evidence of differences between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Adrenaline improved survival through to 12-months follow-up. The study did not find evidence of improvements in favourable neurological outcomes. (ISCRTN 73485024).",

Absolute probabilities were estimated using logistic regression for 1-year outcomes and cause-specific Cox regression for 5-year outcomes. Differences between income-groups were standardized with respect to age, sex, education and comorbidities.\nRESULTS: High-income compared to low-income patients had highest 1-year (96.4% vs. 84.2%) and 5-year (87.6% vs. 64.1%) survival, and lowest 1-year (11.3% vs. 7.4%) and 5-year (13.7% vs. 8.6%) risk of anoxic brain damage/nursing home admission. The corresponding standardized probability differences were 8.2% (95%CI 4.7-11.6%) and 13.9% (95%CI 8.2-19.7%) for 1- and 5-year survival, respectively; and -4.5% (95%CI -8.2 to -1.2%) and -5.1% (95%CI -9.3 to -0.9%) for 1- and 5-year risk of anoxic brain damage/nursing home admission, respectively. Among 831 patients < 66 years working prior to OHCA, 72.1% returned to work within 1 year and 80.8% within 5 years. High-income compared to low-income patients had the highest chance of 1-year (76.4% vs. 58.8%) and 5-year (85.3% vs. 70.6%) return to work with the corresponding absolute probability difference of 18.0% (95%CI 3.8-32.7%) for 1-year and 9.4% (95%CI -3.4 to 22.3%) for 5-year.\nCONCLUSION: Patients of high socioeconomic status had higher probability of long-term survival and return to work, and lower risk of anoxic brain damage/nursing home admission after OHCA compared to patients of low socioeconomic status.",

However, there remains limited knowledge on the long-term physical and psychological problems suffered by survivors and their relatives. The aims of the DANCAS (DANish cardiac arrest survivorship) survey are to describe the prevalence of physical and psychological problems, identify predictors associated with suffering them and to determine unmet rehabilitation needs in order to make recommendations on the timing and content of future rehabilitation interventions.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DANCAS survey has a cross-sectional design involving a survey of OHCA survivors and their relatives. OHCA survivors will be identified through the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry as having suffered an OHCA between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019. Each survivor will be asked to identify their closest relative to complete the relatives' survey. Contents of survivor survey: EQ-5D-5Level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Two Simple Questions, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, 12-item WHO Disability Assessment Scale 2.0, plus questions on unmet rehabilitation and information needs. Contents of relatives' survey: World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index. Self-report outcome data collected through the surveys will be enriched by data from Danish national registries including demographic characteristics, circumstances of cardiac arrest and comorbidities. The survey will be completed either electronically or by post December 2020-February 2021.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Surveys and registry-based research studies do not normally require ethical approval in Denmark. This has been confirmed for this study by the Region of Southern Denmark ethics committee (20192000-19). Results of the study will be disseminated via several peer-reviewed publications and will be presented at national and international conferences.",

Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors.\nMETHODS: A multicentre prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. Patients ≥ 18 years receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by pre-arrest Modified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year.\nRESULTS: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 69.7% was functionally independent.\nCONCLUSION: One-year survival after IHCA in this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies. Survival is associated with a patient's pre-arrest functional status and morbidity. HRQoL appears acceptable, however functional rehabilitation warrants attention. These findings provide a comprehensive insight in in-hospital cardiac arrest prognosis.",

Further, to explore the association between paediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) and intelligence.\nMETHODS: Prospective longitudinal single center study including children (0-17 years) with OHCA, admitted to the PICU of a tertiary care hospital between 2012 and 2017. Survivors were assessed during an outpatient multidisciplinary follow-up program 3-6 and 24 months post-OHCA. Functional and neuropsychological outcomes were assessed through interviews, neurological exam, and validated neuropsychological testing.\nRESULTS: The total eligible cohort consisted of 49 paediatric OHCA survivors. The most common cause of OHCA was arrhythmia (33%). Median age at time of OHCA was 48 months, 67% were males. At 3-6 and 24 months post-OHCA, respectively 74 and 73% had a good PCPC score, defined as 1-2. Compared with normative data, OHCA children obtained worse sustained attention and processing speed scores 3-6 (n = 26) and 24 (n = 27) months post-OHCA. At 24 months, they also obtained worse intelligence, selective attention and cognitive flexibility scores. In children tested at both time-points (n = 19), no significant changes in neuropsychological outcomes were found over time. Intelligence scores did not correlate with PCPC.\nCONCLUSION: Although paediatric OHCA survivors had a good PCPC score 3-6 and 24 months post-OHCA, they obtained worse scores on important neuropsychological domains such as intelligence and executive functioning (attention and cognitive flexibility). Follow-up should continue over a longer life span in order to fully understand the long-term impact of OHCA in childhood.",

The purpose of this study was to assess ADL performance ability by investigating motor and process skills in a consecutive cohort of adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at the time of discharge from hospital.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional study uses data from a prospective cohort of cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. The specific data used in this study were obtained at the time of the days or the day before hospital discharge. Adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to cardiac causes were eligible for inclusion. Assessment of Motor and Process Skills was used to assess ADL performance ability by investigating motor and process skills. The ADL ability of 61 individuals was assessed. The mean ADL ability measures recorded were AMPS process 1.40 logits (0.48) and AMPS motor 1.82 logits (0.40). Based on the dichotomized AMPS results, 23% were most likely to need assistance to live independently in the community.\nCONCLUSION: Performance ability during ADL revealed difficulty in the performance of process skill and an increased need for rehabilitation among survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at the time of hospital discharge.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this review was to investigate neurocognitive outcomes following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Specifically, the focus was on identifying the different neurocognitive domains that are assessed, the measures used, and the level of, and criteria for, impairment.\nDESIGN AND REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from 2006 to 2021 was completed using Medline, Cinahl and Psychinfo. Criteria for inclusion were studies with participants over the age of 18, OHCA and at least one neurocognitive function measure. Qualitative and case studies were excluded. Reviewers assessed criteria and risk of bias using a modified version of Downs and Black.\nRESULTS: Forty-three studies were identified. Most studies had a low risk of bias (n = 31) or moderate risk of bias (n = 11) and one had a high risk; however, only six reported effect sizes or power analyses. Multiple measures of neurocognitive outcomes were used (>50) and level of impairment criteria varied considerably. Memory impairments were frequently found and were also more likely to be impaired followed by executive function and processing speed.\nDISCUSSION: This review highlights the heterogeneity of measures and approaches used to assess neurocognitive outcomes following OHCA as well as the need to improve risk of bias concerning generalizability. Improved understanding of the approaches used for assessment and the subsequent findings will facilitate a standardized evaluation of neurocognitive outcomes following OHCA.",

The primary outcome was good neurological status defined as a Clinical Performance Category score of 1-2 at 12 months after IHCA. The secondary outcomes included the awakening and neurological recovery during the first week, the survival and neurological status at hospital discharge, and the survival at 12 months.\nRESULTS: A total of 291 adult patients with IHCA were included. On the first day and during the first week after IHCA, the awakening was achieved in 61 (21.0 %) and 119 patients (40.9 %), respectively; and neurological recovery in 12 (4.1 %) and 46 patients (15.8 %), respectively. Epileptic seizures developed in 9.7 % following restoration of spontaneous circulation. At hospital discharge, 106 patients (36.4 %) had survived; among them, 63.2 % showed good neurological status. At 12 months, 63 (21.6 %) patients survived; among them, 81.7 % showed good neurological status (17.0 % among all patients with IHCA). Of patients without awakening during the first 3 and 7 days, 2.7 % and 1.2 % showed good neurological status at 12 months, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with IHCA, awakening and neurological recovery were remarkable throughout the first week. Survival and good neurological status were substantial at 12 months after IHCA.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research priority setting in health care has historically been done by expert health care providers and researchers and has not involved patients, family or the public. Survivors & family members have been particularly absent from this process in the field of resuscitation research and specifically adult out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). As such, we sought to conduct a priority setting exercise in partnership with survivors, lay responders and their families in order to ensure that their priorities were visible. We partnered with the James Lind Alliance (UK) and used their commonly used consensus methodology for Public Priority Setting Partnerships (PSPs) to identify research priorities that reflected the perspectives of all stakeholders.\nMETHODS: We used two rounds of public and health care professional surveys to create the initial priority lists. The initial survey collected open-ended questions while the second round consolidated the list of initial questions into a refined list for prioritization. This was done by reviewing existing evidence and thematic categorization by the multi-disciplinary steering committee. An in-person consensus workshop was conducted to come to consensus on the top ten priorities from all perspectives. The McMaster PPEET tool was used to measure engagement.\nRESULTS: The initial survey yielded more than 425 responses and 1450 \"questions\" from survivors and family members (18%), lay responders, health care providers and others. The second survey asked participants to rank a short list of 125 questions. The final top 25 questions were brought to the in-person meeting, and a top ten were selected through the JLA consensus process. The final list of top ten questions included how to improve the rate of lay responder CPR, what interventions used at the scene of an arrest can improve resuscitation and survival, how survival can be improved in rural areas of Canada, what resuscitation medications are most effective, what care patient's family members need, what post-discharge support is needed for survivors, how communication should work for everyone involved with a cardiac arrest, what factors best predict neurologically intact survival, whether biomarkers/genetic tests are effective in predicting OHCA and more research on the short and long-term psycho-social impacts of OHCA on survivors. The PPEET showed overwhelmingly positive results for the patient and family engagement experience during the final workshop.\nCONCLUSIONS: This inclusive research priority setting provides essential information for those doing resuscitation research internationally. The results provide a guide for priority areas of research and should drive our community to focus on questions that matter to survivors and their families in our work. In particular the Canadian Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium will be incorporating the top ten list into its strategic plan for the future.",

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following OHCA.\nMETHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to July 3, 2021, for studies reporting the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among OHCA survivors. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by two authors independently, and a third resolved discrepancies. A single-arm meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool the proportion of patients with these conditions at the earliest follow-up time point in each study and at predefined time points. Meta-regression was performed to identify significant moderators that contributed to between-study heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: The search yielded 15,366 articles. 13 articles were included for analysis, which comprised 186,160 patients. The pooled overall prevalence at the earliest time point of follow-up was 19.0% (11 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0-30.0%) for depression, 26.0% (nine studies; 95% CI = 16.0-39.0%) for anxiety, and 20.0% (three studies; 95% CI = 3.0-65.0%) for PTSD. Meta-regression showed that the age of patients and proportion of female sex were non-significant moderators.\nCONCLUSION: The burden of mental health disorders is high among survivors of OHCA. There is an urgent need to understand the predisposing risk factors and develop preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Sudden cardiac arrest is the most common single cause of death in the contemporary world, but the proportion of survivors is increasing thanks to modern intensive methods of hospital treatment. However, data show that survivors experience high rates of neurological and cognitive deficits and poorer emotional well-being, which is a major challenge in treating these individuals and encouraging their integration in everyday life. These issues range from a number of emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, to lower levels of participation in social life and a low rate of return to their workplace. The need for security and support increases because of the feelings of insecurity, vulnerability and fear of the recurrence of symptoms. Relatives/caregivers who report emotional problems and a higher level of post-traumatic stress are physically and mentally burdened, too. Hence, sudden cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event which is traumatic for survivors and their close relatives. It triggers strong emotional responses that are characteristic of all types of trauma (reliving the trauma, avoidance, negative thoughts and mood, increased agitation). People who have survived trauma thus suffer long-term effects, which are reflected in various dysfunctional behaviours and activities due to inadequate regulation of affective states. Because of these issues, there is a need for effective interventions that can psychologically help patients and relatives after surviving sudden cardiac arrest. In this paper, we will present the model of Relational Family Therapy, which can enable survivors and their relatives to appropriately emotionally-affectively process this experience and thus more appropriately integrate into a new way of life. With the qualitative research method of task analysis, we will show the process of change, which is based on the establishment of a new regulation of affect and allows in-depth processing of difficult emotional states after this event.",

Patient survival to hospital discharge with favourable functional and neurological status is around 21-30%. The Bern University Hospital is a tertiary medical centre in Switzerland with a cardiac arrest team that is available 24 h per day, 7 days per week. Due to lack of central documentation of cardiac arrest team interventions, the incidence, outcomes and survival rates of cardiac arrests in the hospital are unknown. Our aim was to record all cardiac arrest team interventions over 1 year, and to analyse the outcome and survival rates of adult patients after in-hospital cardiac arrests.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective single-centre observational study that recorded all adult in-hospital cardiac arrest team interventions over 1 year, using an Utstein-style case report form. The primary outcome was 30-day survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation, neurological status (after return of spontaneous circulation, after 24 h, after 30 days, after 1 and 5 years), according to the Glasgow Outcomes Scale, and functional status at 30 days and 1 year, according to the Short-form-12 Health Survey.\nRESULTS: The cardiac arrest team had 146 interventions over the study year, which included 60 non-life-threatening alarms (41.1%). The remaining 86 (58.9%) acute life-threatening situations included 68 (79.1%) as patients with cardiac arrest. The mean age of these cardiac arrest patients was 68 ± 13 years, with a male predominance (51/68; 75.0%). Return of spontaneous circulation was recorded in 49 patients (72.1%). Over one-third of the cardiac arrest patients (27/68) were alive after 30 days with favourable neurological outcome. The patients who survived the first year lived also to 5 years after the event with favourable neurological and functional status.\nCONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital cardiac arrest incidence on a large tertiary Swiss university hospital was 1.56 per 1000 patient admissions. After a cardiac arrest, about a third of the patients survived to 5 years with favourable neurological and functional status. Alarms unrelated to life-threatening situations are common and need to be taken into count within a low-threshold alarming system.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02746640).",

However, most studies on cognitive symptoms after cardiac arrest examined cognitive functions within one year after onset. Aim To investigate long‐term changes in cognitive functions in individuals with hypoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. Methods We retrospectively recruited survivors of cardiac arrest who demonstrated cognitive dysfunction at the chronic stage. The inclusion criteria were follow‐up period of more than 3 years with multiple neuropsychological examinations and brain MRI/CT within 1 year after onset. Results Five patients showed various cognitive dysfunctions 1 year after onset, and the follow‐up periods were 3 to 13 years. Four patients showed temporal recovery of cognitive functions over a period of a few years followed by gradual deterioration afterward. The youngest patient, 48 years of age at the final assessment, demonstrated gradual improvement without clear evidence of deterioration for 4 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintense areas at the acute stage in 2 patients, and mild cortical atrophy and cerebral hypoperfusion were observed in 3 patients. Delayed cognitive decline in our cases differs in length of the course from that in previously reported “delayed” postanoxic encephalopathy, which appears several days to weeks after onset. Conclusions Cognitive functions in survivors of cardiac arrest recovered for a few years and then gradually deteriorated, which suggests hypoxic changes induce long‐term impact on cerebral functions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are 20,000 sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs) in Australia annually, with 90% case-fatality.\nOBJECTIVE: The present study calculated both the health and economic impact of SCAs in Victoria, Australia.\nMETHODS: Data on all SCAs attended by Ambulance Victoria from July 2017 to June 2018 were collected regarding age, gender, and survival to hospital, discharge and 12 months. Pre-SCA employment status of all patients was modelled using age and gender-matched Australian economic data. A Markov state-transition model with a five-year horizon calculated health and economic impact in years of life lived (YLL), productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) and gross domestic product (GDP) lost. A counterfactual Markov state-transition model assessed outcomes of an identical cohort of patients who did not experience SCA. All values were discounted by 5%.\nRESULTS: In 12 months, 4637 people suffered SCAs in Victoria, of whom 1516 (32.7%) were working at the time. 695 patients (15.0%) survived to hospital, 325 (7.0%) to discharge, and 303 (6.5%) to 12 months. In five years following their SCA, the cohort lost 15,922 years of life and 2327 PALYs. Reduced productivity led to GDP losses of AUD$448 million (92.8% relative reduction). Extrapolated to the 20,000 SCAs occurring across all of Australia, total GDP losses approached AUD$2 billion.\nCONCLUSION: The health and economic burden of SCAs is high, predominantly underpinned by very high mortality. Annual national losses approach AUD$2 billion (USD$1.42 billion) and are comparable to productivity losses from all cancers combined. Prioritising research and state-of-the-art care for SCA patients appears economically sound.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death. Family members often witness the event and attempt resuscitation. The physiological and psychological impact of a loved one's death, witnessed or unwitnessed, can be significant and long-lasting. However, little is known about the care needs of families during the cardiac arrest care of a loved one. This scoping review protocol was designed with, and will be performed in partnership with, persons with lived experience of sudden cardiac arrest (survivors and family members of survivors and nonsurvivors alike).\nMETHODS: The review will be performed in accordance with accepted methods such as the Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework and the Levac extension. We will search multiple databases, and Google Scholar for both qualitative and quantitative scientific literature. Articles will be screened, extracted, and analyzed by a team with lived experience of cardiac arrest. Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data extraction independently. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data.\nDISCUSSION: This protocol outlines a planned literature review to systematically examine the nature of existing evidence to describe what the care needs of families experiencing the cardiac arrest of a loved one are. Such evidence will contribute to the development of strategies to meet identified care needs. Persons with lived experience participated in the creation of this protocol, and they will also participate in the execution of this review as partners and coinvestigators, not as research subjects or participants. The results of the scoping review will be disseminated upon completion of the work described in this protocol.",

    "abstract": "AIM: Cardiac arrest (CA) survival has diverse psychosocial outcomes for both survivors and their close family, with little known regarding long-term adjustment and recovery experiences. We explored the psychological adjustment and experiential perspectives of survivors and families in the second year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: A prospective, mixed-methods study of adult OHCA survivors in Victoria, Australia was conducted. Eighteen survivors and 12 family members completed semi-structured interviews 14-19 months post-arrest. Survivors' cognition, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured using a battery of psychological assessments. A thematic content analysis approach was applied to qualitative interview data by two independent investigators, with data coded and categorised into themes and sub-themes.\nRESULTS: Survivors' cognition, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were not clinically elevated in the second year post-arrest. Subjective cognitive failures were associated with increased anxiety but not with mental state. Depression was significantly correlated with post-traumatic symptoms. Six primary themes emerged from survivors' recovery stories, focused on: awakening and realisation, barriers to adjustment, psychosocial difficulties, integration, protective factors and unmet needs. Family perspectives revealed four primary themes focused on trauma exposure, survivor adjustment problems, family impact, and areas for service improvement.\nCONCLUSION: Survivors and their family members describe complex recovery journeys characterised by a range of psychosocial adjustment challenges, which are not adequately captured by common psychological measures. Post-arrest care systems are perceived by survivors and their families as inadequate due to a lack of accurate information regarding post-arrest sequalae, limited follow-up and inconsistent access to allied health care.",

The objective of this systematic review will be to identify, appraise, and meta-synthesize qualitative evidence regarding family care-needs when experiencing cardiac arrest. Methods: This systematic review of qualitative studies and meta-synthesis will be conducted by multidisciplinary researchers in partnership with patient and family partners who have lived-experience of cardiac arrest. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Theses and Dissertations Global, SocIndex, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. We will include qualitative research describing the experience and care needs of family members. We will also search reference lists, conduct forward citation searches, and contact content experts. We will assess the methodological quality of included studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Two team members will independently review studies, extract data, and assess methodological quality. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will use thematic framework analysis to analyze and synthesize narrative data, after which the review team and stakeholders discuss the findings and make any necessary changes. Our thematic synthesis will follow three steps: (i) initial coding and grouping of codes, (ii) formation of descriptive themes, and (iii) transcending the data to form novel insights and theories (analytical themes). The review will be reported in accordance with the ENTREQ and GRIPP2 guidelines. We will apply the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative (CERQual) research to assess the robustness of our findings.

    "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: Globally, there has been an increase in the survival rate and the average age of survivors from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, little is known about the joint OHCA-associated experiences among older survivors and their spouses in a long-term perspective. The aim of this study was to explore how narrative sense-making processes following OHCA shapes everyday life in a long-term perspective among older survivors and their spouses.\nMETHODS: Five older male survivors and their female spouses were interviewed individually using narrative methods. Arthur Frank's theory on illness narratives informed the analysis. Participant observation at two meetings for survivors and relatives regarding cardiac arrest was used for qualification of the interview guide.\nRESULTS: Five married couples participated. The mean age of the survivors and spouses was 70,4 and 71,4 years respectively, and time since OHCA varied from 12 to 66 months. Two themes of the dyadic experience emerged: 1) experiences during OHCA, and 2) experiences in life following OHCA. Subthemes differed with survivors emphasising a desire to return to the same life as before the OHCA, and the spouses narrating feelings of anxiety. Potential complications of the OHCA were often explained with reference to ageing processes, and the OHCA was contextualised in relation to previous life-changing events.\nCONCLUSION: In a long-term perspective, OHCA shapes the life trajectory of both the survivor and the spouse, and the relationship between them, underscoring a need for patient-centred care with a greater focus on the relationship of the dyads.",

Patients >80 years and those 18-80 years with OHCA from 4/2005-12/2010 were compared.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME: survival at four time points; secondary outcomes: neurological and functional status at hospital discharge, and relationship between survival, age and pre-arrest activities of daily living (ADL) and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scores (higher scores indicate worse function in both).\nRESULTS: 3,211 patients (1,259 >80 years, 1952 aged 18-80) with median follow-up 5.9 years (range 0.1-11.1 years) were included. Survival was better for younger patients at all four time points, including 7.8% versus 2.5% at hospital discharge, 4.6% versus 0.2% at late follow-up. Functional status at discharge was also better, 4.8 ± 5.4 versus 9.0 ± 4.7, p<0.001, and more young patients had CPC1/2, 60.7% versus 32.2%, p = 0.004. Older patients who survived to emergency department admission had increased mortality per year of age (2.6%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.026, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.006-1.048 versus 1.7%, HR 1.017, 95% CI 1.010-1.025), per point in pre-arrest ADL (3.0%, HR 1.030, 95% CI 1.007-1.054 versus 5.8%, HR 1.058, 95% CI 1.036-1.080), and per point in pre-arrest CPC (24%, HR 1.242, 95% CI 1.097-1.406 versus 37%, HR 1.370 95% CI 1.232-1.524).\nCONCLUSION: Patient independence before arrest may be a more crucial determinant of resuscitation outcome than older age alone. Discussion of end-of-life preferences is particularly important for older individuals with functional and cognitive decline.",

Given that many post-CA patients are lost to follow-up (LTFU), we explored whether these patients are systematically different from those who complete follow-up based on demographic, resuscitation and outcome characteristics.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 168 English-speaking CA survivors between 9/25/2016 and 5/31/2018. We measured demographic data and global functional outcomes using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) in-person at hospital discharge, and via telephone at 3-, 6-months, and 1-year. We compared patients LTFU (e.g., failure to contact or refused to follow-up) with those contacted. Patients who were hospitalized, in a rehabilitation facility, missed by the research team, or dead were considered not eligible for follow-up.\nRESULTS: Of the 116 patients eligible for follow-up at 3-months, the majority completed follow-up (n = 69; 59.5%) and 47 (40.5%) were LTFU. Conversely, at 6-months and 1-year, fewer subjects were assessed (42% and 47%) compared to those who were LTFU (58% and 53%), respectively. At 3-months, LTFU patients were younger, unmarried, and had longer ICU stay. At 6-months and 1-year, LTFU patients were primarily male, had a non-shockable primary rhythm, and non-cardiac arrest etiologies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of patients are LTFU during the first year after CA, and differences emerged for demographics and characteristics of the event. Future research should account for the informative, non-random distribution of patients LTFU.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment and psychopathology caused by brain hypoxia and the traumatic impact of critical illness are common in cardiac arrest survivors and can lead to negative consequences of everyday life functioning, and further impact mental health in relatives. Most studies have dealt with the mere survival rate after cardiac arrest and not with long-term consequences to mental health in cardiac arrest survivors. Importantly, we face a gap in our knowledge about suitable screening tools in the early post-arrest phase for long-term risk prediction of mental health problems. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel screening procedure to predict risk of disabling cognitive impairment and psychopathology 3 months after cardiac arrest. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate long-term prevalence of psychopathology in relatives.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSES: In this multicentre prospective cohort study, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors and their relatives will be recruited. The post-arrest screening includes the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI) and is conducted during hospitalisation. In a subsample of the patients, functional MRI is done, and cortisol determination collected. At 3-month follow-up, the primary study outcomes for 200 survivors include the Danish Affective Verbal Learning Test-26 (VAMT-26), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System tests (trail making, colour-word interference, word and design fluency), Rey's Complex Figure and Letter-number sequencing subtest of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, HADS and IES-R. For the relatives, they include HADS and IES-R.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the local regional Research Ethics Committee (H-18046155) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (RH-2017-325, j.no.05961) and follows the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and may impact the follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors.",

During this process, survivors are placed into a mild hypothermic state with their body temperature maintained at 32°C to 36°C for a minimum of 24 hours. It is during this time that family members experience the uncertainty of whether their loved one will survive, or if any negative long-term sequelae will be experienced. While much is known about the physical application and management of targeted temperature management, less is known about the psychosocial aspects of this treatment.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider qualitative studies that address the experiences of family members of adult patients who have received targeted temperature management following a cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: CINAHL, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, PsycINFO, PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science will be searched for relevant studies. Studies published in English and French from 2002 onward will be considered. Two reviewers will independently appraise studies and extract qualitative data using the JBI standardized critical appraisal and extraction instruments. Findings from the review will be categorized according to similarity in meaning, and categories subjected to a meta-aggregation to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesized findings.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42020142942.",

A telephone interview was performed based on a questionnaire sent 3-6 months post cardiac arrest, including EQ-5D-5L and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear- and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to describe and compare HRQoL in OHCA and IHCA survivors. Adjustments were made for sex, age and initial rhythm.\nRESULTS: In all, 1369 IHCA and 772 OHCA survivors were included. Most OHCA and IHCA survivors reported no symptoms of with anxiety (88% and 84%) or depression (87% and 85%). IHCA survivors reported significantly more problems in the health domains mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain/discomfort (p < 0.001 for all) and scored lower general health measured by EQ-VAS (median 70 vs. 80 respectively, p < 0.001) compared with the OHCA survivors.\nCONCLUSION: Survivors of IHCA reported significantly worse HRQoL compared to survivors of OHCA.

The primary outcome measure was Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score at M18. Secondary outcome measures included evaluation at M18 of neurologic, behavioral, and cognitive disabilities; health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), anxiety and depression; and poor-outcome risk factors (GOS-E score ≤ 6).\nRESULTS: Among the 139 included patients, 98 were assessable for the primary outcome measure. At M18, 64 (65%) had full recovery or minor disabilities (GOS-E score > 6), 18 (18%) had moderate disabilities but were autonomous for daily-life activities (GOS-E score = 6), 12 (12%) had poor autonomy (GOS-E score < 6 but > 1), and four had died.

At M18, no patients had major neurologic disabilities, 20% had cognitive disabilities, 32% had anxiety symptoms, 25% had depression symptoms, and their HR-QOL was impaired compared with a sex- and age-matched population. Low-flow time, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at admission, coma duration > 3 days after cardiac arrest, and mechanical ventilation on days 3 and 7 were associated with poor functional outcome.\nINTERPRETATION: Among patients who awoke (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥12) in the 14 days following OHCA, 35% had moderate to severe disabilities or had died at M18. Interestingly, patients improved until M18 post-OHCA. Risk factors associated with poor functional outcome were low-flow time, clinical severity at ICU admission, prolonged coma duration, and mechanical ventilation.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT02292147; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.",

However, survivors are at risk of neurological impairment from anoxic brain damage which could affect quality of life and lead to need of care at home or in a nursing home.\nMETHODS: We linked data on ICHAs in Denmark with nationwide registries to report 30-day survival as well as factors associated with survival. Furthermore, among 30-day survivors we reported the one-year cumulative risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission with mortality as the competing risk.\nRESULTS: In total, 517 patients (27.3%) survived to day 30 out of 1892 eligible patients; 338 (65.9%) were men and median age was 68 (interquartile range 58-76). Lower age, witnessed arrest by health care personnel, monitored arrest and presumed cardiac cause of arrest were associated with 30-day survival. Among 454 30-day survivors without prior anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission, the risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission within the first-year post-arrest was 4.6% (n = 21; 95% CI 2.7-6.6%) with a competing risk of death of 15.6% (n = 71; 95% CI 12.3-19.0%), leaving 79.7% (n = 362) alive without anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission. When adding the risk of need of in-home care among 343 30-day survivors without prior home care needs, 68.8% (n = 236) were alive without any of the composite events one-year post-arrest.\nCONCLUSION: The majority of 30-day survivors of IHCA are alive at one-year follow-up without anoxic brain damage, nursing home admission or need of in-home care.",

Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition data were available on 96% of 3-month survivors (242/251) and 95% of 12-month survivors (239/251) with no differences in demographics between those with and without completed Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition. At 12 months, a substantial minority of interviews were completed with caregivers other than parents (10%), after calls attempts were made on 6 or more days (18%), and during evenings/weekends (17%). Strategies included emphasizing the relationship between study teams and participants, ongoing communication between study team members across sites, promoting site engagement during the study's final year, and withholding payment for work associated with the primary outcome until work had been completed.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use telephone follow-up interviews to successfully collect detailed neurobehavioral outcome about children following pediatric cardiac arrest. Future studies should consider availability of the telephone interviewer to conduct calls at times convenient for families, using a range of respondents, ongoing engagement with site teams, and site payment related to primary outcome completion.",

Survivors completed the Questionnaire for the Quality of Provider-Patient Interactions (QQPPI), Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). When completing the QQPPI and RHDS, survivors were asked to think back to their hospitalization and discharge. QoL domains (physical, psychological, social) were measured via the WHO-QOL BREF. Three multiple regression models examined associations between QQPPI, RHDS, and B-IPQ scores with QoL domains, adjusted for age, sex, months since arrest, self-reported understanding of cardiac arrest and potential post-arrest symptoms at discharge, self-reported memory at discharge, and functional status as defined by the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.\nRESULTS: A total of 163 survivors (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean time since arrest: 63.9 months) provided complete survey data. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.45, p ​< ​0.001) and lower readiness for discharge (β: 0.21, p ​= ​0.01) were associated with worse physical QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.47, p ​< ​0.001) was associated with worse psychological QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.28, p ​= ​0.001) and poor provider-patient communication (β: 0.35, p ​< ​0.001) were associated with worse social QoL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modifiable provider-patient relationship factors and illness perceptions were associated with quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest with good neurologic recovery.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over 400,000 adults suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) each year in North America. Despite a very high mortality rate, even 10% survival means that a minimum of 3500 people return to their lives and their families. However, their experience of living and their health-related quality of life after such a life-changing event are quite variable, much more complex than just having lived or died, and should not be reduced to crude measures of neurological functioning.\nMETHODS: We conducted 32 in-depth qualitative interviews with survivor/family member dyads at various stages of survival. The interviews focused on the recovery journey, long-term issues most important to them and how measuring such concepts could help. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative thematic analysis techniques.\nRESULTS: During in-depth interviews with more than 30 survivors and caregivers we have heard that despite being a relatively high functioning group, their lives have been deeply affected by their cardiac arrest experience. They speak about the importance of both psychologic and physical recovery, the impact of return to work or changes in work identity and the necessity of support from family members in the recovery process. Spouses/family members also mentioned differences in perspective on their loved one's recovery and how they manage the fear of recurrence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work purposively brings a unique lens to the concept of cardiac arrest outcomes by placing priority on what is important to survivors and their families and what we may be missing in standard outcomes measures. There is a clear need for a more patient-centred outcome set for this population and our work indicates that psychologic assessment, return to work status and family input are key domains to be considered.",

Approximately 7 and 24 months after OHCA, survivors at selected study sites are invited to a standardized assessment, including performance-based tests of cognition and questionnaires of emotional problems, fatigue, executive function and insomnia. At 1:1 ratio, a matched control group from a cohort of acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients is recruited to perform the same assessment. We aim to include 100 patients per group. Potential differences between the OHCA patients and the MI controls at 7 and 24 months will be analyzed with a linear regression, using composite z-scores per cognitive domain (verbal, visual/constructive, working memory, episodic memory, processing speed, executive functions) as primary outcome measures. Results from OHCA survivors on the main TTM2-trial neurocognitive screening battery will be compared with neuropsychological test results at 7 months, using sensitivity and specificity analyses.\nDISCUSSION: In this study we collect detailed information on cognitive impairment after OHCA and compare this to a control group of patients with acute MI. The validation of the TTM2 neurocognitive screening battery could justify its inclusion in routine follow-up. Our results may have a potential to impact on the design of future follow-up strategies and interventions after OHCA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03543371 . Registered 1 June 2018.",

This paper presents the design and rationale of the TTM2-trial follow-up, where information on secondary and exploratory outcomes will be collected. We also present the explorative outcome analyses which will focus on neurocognitive function and societal participation in OHCA-survivors.\nMETHODS: Blinded outcome-assessors will perform follow-up at 30-days after the OHCA with a telephone interview, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). Face-to-face meetings will be performed at 6 and 24-months, and include reports on outcome from several sources of information: clinician-reported: mRS, GOSE; patient-reported: EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level responses version (EQ-5D-5L), Life satisfaction, Two Simple Questions; observer-reported: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA) and neurocognitive performance measures: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Exploratory analyses will be performed with an emphasis on brain injury in the survivors, where the two intervention groups will be compared for potential differences in neuro-cognitive function (MoCA, SDMT) and societal participation (GOSE). Strategies to increase inter-rater reliability and decrease missing data are described.\nDISCUSSION: The TTM2-trial follow-up is a pragmatic yet detailed pre-planned and standardised assessment of patient's outcome designed to ensure data-quality, decrease missing data and provide optimal conditions to investigate clinically relevant effects of TTM, including OHCA-survivors' neurocognitive function and societal participation.",

The associations between an individual's level of participation in physical activities (Participation Objective Participation Subjective) and their levels of cognition (Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment), body movement (Keitel Functional Test), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), ambulation and pain (Health Utilities Index Mark 3), and fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were explored.

We found moderate, negative associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors of depressive symptoms (=-0.590), pain (=-0.495), physical fatigue impact (=-0.629), cognitive fatigue impact (=-0.591), and psychosocial fatigue impact (=-0.557).\nCONCLUSION: The moderate, negative and positive associations between participation in physical activities and subjective factors suggest that subjective complaints of depressive symptoms, ambulation ability, pain, and fatigue impact may be important factors when seeking to improve participation in physical activities. In particular, addressing physical and cognitive endurance as well as perceptions of fatigue may hold the key to increasing physical activity in cardiac arrest survivors with fatigue.",

Although the incidence of cardiac arrest and influencing factors are well researched, little is known of survivors’ experiences as they return home from hospital. This article aims to explore survivors’ experiences of returning home after surviving a cardiac arrest. Four females and 13 males, all independently living cardiac arrest survivors, were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling techniques and participated in individual in-depth interviews over a six-month period. This inquiry follows COREQ guidelines and data were analysed using narrative inquiry where key threads were identified. Findings indicate that a cardiac arrest is a catastrophic event where the survivor has to accept and adjust mentally, physically and socially, often leading to insecurity about the future. The cardiac arrest impacts all aspects of life on return home, including the ability to work and to drive, accepting added medical appointments and medication regimens. Healthcare professionals can learn from survivors’ narratives to support holistic care, considering survivors’ experiences in their transition home and back to reality as a cardiac arrest survivor.",

Data from six audiotaped focus group interviews were collected in either November 2018 or in March 2019. Analysis and interpretation of the transcribed texts was performed using a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach guided by Ricoeur for unfolding lived experiences.\nRESULTS: Three narratives were identified. The survivors narrated how they in the early phase after the cardiac arrest experienced: (a) 'a fragmented memory at the mercy of the system'. The analysis further showed how the participants were: (b) 'living in the shadow of anxiety and mixed feelings' and with the: (c) 'lost sense of self' up to several years after survival.\nCONCLUSION: The participants in our study experienced distinct bodily impairments, suffering, and the lost sense of self in the return to daily life from early on to several years after resuscitation. There seem to be an urgent need for an early initiated post-arrest transitional care program led by an expert cardiac arrest nurse. In particular, the healthcare professionals need to pay attention to survivors in employment and with children living at home. Facilitated cardiac arrest peer support groups might minimize the long-term suffering, heighten the self-image, and install a new hope for the future.\nIMPACT: To ease the post-arrest return to daily life for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors it seems important that a transitional care program from the inhospital setting to the community consist of: (a) screening for and education on bodily losses at an early stage, (b) provision of support on the often prolonged emotional reactions, and (c) referring for further individual and targeted psychological and neurological follow-up and rehabilitation if needed.",

Data was analysed using a phenomenographic approach.\nSETTING: The participants were nineteen Swedish registered nurses, experienced in cardiovascular care and providing follow-up care.\nFINDINGS: The nurses perceived the cognitive impairment of the survivors in qualitatively different ways, as illustrated in two categories: 'The perceptible and obvious' and 'The elusive and challenging'. The nurses perceived a variety of signs of cognitive impairment, emotional expressions related to these, and recovery from cognitive impairment. They perceived confidence in capturing cognitive function when they understood the signs of cognitive impairment as severe and obvious. However, it was perceived as difficult to assess cognitive function when impairments were subtle, resulting in uncertainty in terms of how to make assessments. Nurses made use of their own strategies for assessments, which were sometimes found to be inadequate when they understood that they had misinterpreted the survivors' cognitive impairment.\nCONCLUSION: Nurses feel uncertainty regarding detecting mild impairment in cardiac arrest survivors. By involving next of kin, nurses will gain a broader understanding of survivors' cognitive function.",

This study investigated mean arterial pressure after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and the association with brain injury and long-term cognitive function.\nMETHODS: Post-hoc analysis of patients surviving at least 48 hours in the biobank substudy of the targeted temperature management trial with available blood pressure data. Patients were stratified in three groups according to mean arterial pressure during targeted temperature management (4-28 hours after admission; <70 mmHg, 70-80 mmHg, >80 mmHg). A biomarker of brain injury, neuron-specific enolase, was measured and impaired cognitive function was defined as a mini-mental state examination score below 27 in 6-month survivors.\nRESULTS: Of the 657 patients included in the present analysis, 154 (23%) had mean arterial pressure less than 70 mmHg, 288 (44%) had mean arterial pressure between 70 and 80 mmHg and 215 (33%) had mean arterial pressure greater than 80 mmHg. There were no statistically significant differences in survival (=0.35) or neuron-specific enolase levels (=0.12) between the groups. The level of target temperature did not statistically significantly interact with mean arterial pressure regarding neuron-specific enolase (=0.58). In the subgroup of survivors with impaired cognitive function (=132) (35%) mean arterial pressure during targeted temperature management was significantly higher (=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, low mean arterial pressure during targeted temperature management was not associated with higher neuron-specific enolase regardless of the level of target temperature (33°C or 36°C for 24 hours). In survivors with impaired cognitive function, mean arterial pressure during targeted temperature management was significantly higher.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of global mortality, survival rates have increased over the last decade. As such, there is an increasing need to explore long-term functional outcomes of survivors, such as return to work (RTW).\nMETHODOLOGY: We analysed baseline and 12-month follow-up data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry for patients that arrested between 2010 and 2016 who were working prior to their arrest. We also conducted more detailed RTW interviews in a subset of OHCA survivors who arrested between July and September 2017. Factors associated with RTW were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 884 previously working survivors were included in the analysis, 650 (73%) of whom RTW. Male sex (AOR 1.80; 95%CI: 1.10-2.94), arrests witnessed by emergency medical services (AOR 2.72; 95%CI: 1.50-9.25), discharge directly home from hospital (AOR 4.13; 95%CI: 2.38-7.18) and favourable 12-month health-related quality of life according to the EQ-5D were associated with RTW. Increasing age (AOR 0.97; 95%CI: 0.95-0.98), traumatic arrest aetiology (AOR 0.18; 95%CI: 0.04-0.77), and labour-intensive occupations (AOR 0.44; 95%CI: 0.29-0.66) were associated with decreased odds of RTW. Of the 23 OHCA survivors that participated in the more detailed RTW telephone-interview, 87% RTW. Flexible work hours or modified duties were offered to 74% of participants. Fatigue was the most frequently reported barrier to RTW.\nCONCLUSION: This is the largest study to collectively examine factors associated with RTW among survivors of OHCA. Although larger qualitative studies are needed, our findings highlight which patients are at risk of not RTW and who may benefit from targeted rehabilitation strategies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is common and associated with high mortality. Frailty is increasingly recognized as a predictor of worse prognosis among critically ill patients, but its association with outcomes and resource utilization following IHCA is unknown.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis (2013-2016) of a prospectively collected registry from two hospitals of consecutive hospitalized adult patients with IHCA occurring on the hospital wards. We defined frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score ≥5. CFS scores were based on validated medical review criteria. The primary outcome is hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes include return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), discharge to long-term care, and hospital costs. We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for known confounders.\nRESULTS: We included 477 patients, and 124 (26.0%) had frailty. Frailty was associated with increased odds of hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.91 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.37-3.48) and discharge to long-term care (aOR 1.94 [95% CI: 1.57-2.32]). Compared with patients without frailty, patients with frailty had decreased odds of ROSC following IHCA (aOR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.41-0.93]). No difference in mean total costs was demonstrated between patients with and without frailty ($50,799 vs. $45,849). Frail patients did have higher cost-per-survivor ($947,546 vs. $161,550).\nCONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals who experience an IHCA are more likely to die in hospital or be discharged to long-term care, and less likely to achieve ROSC in comparison with individuals who are not frail. The hospital costs per-survivor of IHCA are increased when frailty is present.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Targeted temperature management (TTM) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has been recommended in international guidelines since 2005. The TTM-trial published in 2013 showed no difference in survival or neurological outcome for patients randomised to 33 °C or 36 °C, and many hospitals have changed practice. The optimal utilization of TTM is still debated. This study aimed to analyse if a difference in temperature goal was associated with outcome in an unselected international registry population.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective observational study based on a prospective registry - the International Cardiac Arrest Registry 2. Patients were categorized as receiving TTM in the lower range at 32-34 °C (TTM-low) or at 35-37 °C (TTM-high). Primary outcome was good functional status defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1-2 at hospital discharge and secondary outcome was adverse events related to TTM. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the independent effect of temperature by correcting for clinical and demographic factors associated with outcome.\nRESULTS: Of 1710 patients included, 1242 (72,6%) received TTM-low and 468 (27,4%) TTM-high. In patients receiving TTM-low, 31.3% survived with good outcome compared to 28.8% in the TTM-high group. There was no significant association between temperature and outcome (p = 0.352). In analyses adjusted for baseline differences the OR for a good outcome with TTM-low was 1.27, 95% CI (0.94-1.73). Haemodynamic instability leading to discontinuation of TTM was more common in TTM-low.\nCONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in functional outcome at hospital discharge was found in patients receiving lower- versus higher targeted temperature management.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested gender disparities in neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest (CA). However, the relation between gender and cognitive outcome has been rarely examined. Here we investigated whether sex is associated with cognitive outcome after CA events.: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data collected at our institution from January 2006 to May 2017. Patients were included if they had a documented CA and were able to participate in structured neuropsychological testing. Cognitive status was assessed at about 2.1 month after CA and included tests of attention as well as short and long-term memory. Gender was used as the main predictor of outcome and was studied in relation to age, depressive mood, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), and other potential confounders.: Males were more likely to show favorable cognitive outcome in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Women were more likely to exhibit depressive mood. Patients who underwent TH (31% of the patients) did not show any gender differences in benefits from the treatment. Among males and females, no significant differences between age groups could be observed.: Male sex was associated with favorable cognitive outcome after CA which could not be attributed to baseline characteristics.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: While cardiac arrest (CA) patients discharged alive from intensive care unit (ICU) are considered to have good one-year survival but potential neurological impairment, comparisons with other ICU sub-populations non-admitted for CA purpose are still lacking. This study aimed to compare long-term outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between CA patients and patients admitted to ICU for all other causes.\nMETHODS: In 1635 patients discharged alive from 21 European ICUs in an ancillary analysis of a prospective multicentric cohort, we compared CA causes of ICU admission to all other causes of ICU admissions (named non-CAs). The primary endpoint was one-year survival rate after ICU discharge. Secondary endpoints included HRQOL at 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge using the outcome survey short form-36 (SF36). Propensity score matching was used to consider the probability of having CA.\nRESULTS: Of the 1635 patients, 1561 were included in this study comprised of 1447 non-CAs and 114 CAs. At one-year in the non-matched population, survival rate was greater in the CA group 89% versus the non-CA group 78% (log rank p = 0.0056). In the matched population, this difference persisted between CAs and non-CAs (log rank p = 0.049). The physical component summary of the SF36 scale was higher in the CA group than in the non-CA group at all time points in both non-matched and matched populations.\nCONCLUSIONS: CA patients discharged alive from ICU have a better one-year survival and a better HRQOL specifically on physical functions than patients admitted to ICU for other causes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01367093; registered on June 6, 2011.",

Patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at hospital arrival were included. Thirty-day survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission and return to work among 30-day survivors were evaluated using Aalen-Johansen estimates and cause-specific Cox regression.\nRESULTS: Upon hospital arrival of 13,953 OHCA patients, 776 (5.6%) had ROSC and were conscious (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS]>8), 5205 (37.3%) had ROSC, but were comatose (GCS ≤ 8), and 7972 (57.1%) had ongoing CPR. Thirty-day survival according to status at hospital arrival among patients that were conscious, comatose, or had ongoing CPR was 89.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.8%-91.2%), 39.0% (95% CI 37.6%-40.3%), and 1.2% (95% CI 1.0%-1.4%), respectively. Among 30-day survivors, 1-year risks of new onset anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission according to consciousness status were 2.4% (95% CI 1.2%-3.6%), 12.9% (95% CI 11.4%-14.3%), and 19.4% (95% CI 11.3%-27.4%), respectively. Among 30-day working-age survivors, more than 65% in each group returned to work within 5 years.\nCONCLUSION: Consciousness status at hospital arrival was strongly associated with 30-day survival in OHCA patients. Among 30-day survivors, a minority was diagnosed with anoxic brain damage or admitted to a nursing home and the majority returned to work independent of consciousness status at hospital arrival.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considering the significant morbidity and mortality of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, only little data on survival or quality of life after successful resuscitation is available in Europe. Additionally, economic aspects of such events are poorly studied. The purpose of this study is to provide data for survival, quality of life and costs directly related to the cardiac arrest for a region of Switzerland served by one emergency medical service (EMS).\nMETHODS: Eighty eight patients older than 18 years of age that were resuscitated by the EMS Winterthur in the year 2013 were included and retrospective analysis of EMS-protocols was performed. For patients alive at follow-up, 2 years after the event, a structured interview with quality of life questionnaires was conducted. This study was accepted by the local Ethics Committee.\nRESULTS: Thirty five percent (n = 31) of resuscitated patients were admitted alive to the hospital following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This incidence was as high as 60%, if the patients had a shockable rhythm as first rhythm. Survival to follow-up was 16% (n = 14). These patients had an excellent quality of life overall, with little to no limitations in daily life. There was no significant difference in survival for patients in outlying regions with comparatively longer timespans until arrival of EMS. Median EMS-costs for deceased patients were CHF 1731 (inter-quartile range 346), for survivors CHF 2'169 (inter-quartile range CHF 444) and median hospital-costs were CHF 27'707 (inter-quartile range CHF 62'783).\nCONCLUSION: Quality of care for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the region of Winterthur is high, including patients in outlying regions. The associated costs are similar to other European countries.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov under NCT02625883.",

    "abstract": "AIM OF THE STUDY: Advances in resuscitation science have resulted in a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. However, we know very little about the natural history of recovery and the unmet needs of survivors and their partners. This qualitative study sought to address this knowledge gap to improve understanding of the consequences of surviving cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken separately with survivors and their partners between 3 and 12-months following the cardiac arrest. An interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA) to data analysis was adopted. Developing themes were discussed between members of the research team.\nRESULTS: 8 survivors (41-79 years; 5 male; mean time 6.3 months post-hospital discharge) and 3 partners (1 male) were interviewed. The key (super-ordinate) theme of being 'trapped in a disrupted normality' was identified within the data. Five related subordinate themes included: existential impact, physical ramifications, emotional consequences, limiting participation in social activities and altered family roles.\nCONCLUSION: Recovery for survivors is hindered by a wide range of physical, emotional, cognitive, social and spiritual challenges that disrupt perceptions of 'normality'. Survivors and their carers may benefit from focussing on establishing a 'new normal' rather than striving to achieve a pre-cardiac social and physical position. Survivor-centred assessment should support rather than undermine this goal.",
