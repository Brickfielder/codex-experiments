    "abstract": "AIM: Self-reported cognitive function has been described as an important complement to performance-based measurements but has seldom been investigated in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors. Therefore, the aim was to describe self-reported cognitive function and its association with health status, psychological distress, and life satisfaction.\nMETHODS: This study utilised data from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (2018-2021), registered 3-6 months post-CA. Cognitive function was assessed by a single question: \"How do you experience your memory, concentration, and/or planning abilities today compared to before the cardiac arrest?\". Health status was measured using the EQ VAS, psychological distress with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and overall life satisfaction with the Life Satisfaction checklist. Data were analysed using binary logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Among 4026 identified survivors, 1254 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65.9 years (SD = 13.4) and 31.7% were female. Self-reported cognitive function among survivors was reported as: 'Much worse' by 3.1%, 'Worse' by 23.8%, 'Unchanged' by 68.3%, 'Better' by 3.3%, and 'Much better' by 1.5%. Declined cognitive function was associated with lower health status (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 2.09-3.64), symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.84, 95% CI = 2.80-5.24) and depression (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 3.22-6.32), and being dissatisfied with overall life (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.11-3.54). These associations remained significant after age, sex, place of CA, aetiology, initial rhythm, initial witnessed status, and cerebral performance were controlled.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survivors experiencing declined cognitive function post-CA are at a higher risk of poorer health status, increased psychological distress, and reduced life satisfaction, and these risks should be acknowledged by healthcare professionals.",

Although resuscitation advancements have increased survival, many survivors suffer cognitive impairments that affect their quality of life. Most research has focused on neurological outcomes, whereas little attention has been paid to cognitive function. The aim is to investigate the proportion of cognitive impairment in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest and to investigate the association between the duration of cardiac arrest and level of cognitive function.\nMETHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 184 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening tool. Duration of cardiac arrest was defined by no flow, low flow, and time to return of spontaneous circulation. Multiple logistic regression analysis provided odds ratios (OR) and CI.\nRESULTS: Of 184 survivors assessed, 26% had normal cognitive function at discharge, increasing to 67% at 6 months (n=149). Median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score improved from 23 (Q25-Q75: 20-26) to 26 (Q25-Q75: 24-28). At 6 months, adjusted ORs per minute were 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for low flow and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07) for time to return of spontaneous circulation, whereas associations at discharge were near null (aOR≈0.99). No significant association was found either at discharge or follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function improved considerably within 6 months following cardiac arrest, with the proportion of patients exhibiting normal cognitive function increasing from 26% to 67%. This study found no association between the duration of cardiac arrest and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Background Assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive screening are widely used in the care of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Evidence linking them to post-discharge outcomes is limited, but could support targeted rehabilitation efforts. Aim To assess whether ADL ability measures and cognitive screening at hospital discharge were associated with post-discharge ADL ability, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and return to work. Methods This prospective cohort study included 200 OHCA survivors admitted to Aarhus University Hospital. Self-reported ADL ability was measured using the Activities of Daily Living Interview (ADL-I). Observed ADL ability was measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), dichotomised into age-matched or below-ability. Cognitive function was assessed with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Multivariable regressions, with multiple imputation, analysed associations between variables and outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Adjusted analyses showed significant associations between personal ADL-I (βadjusted = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.2;0.5) and AMPS (βadjusted = -0.6, 95%CI:-1.2;-0.03) at discharge and self-reported ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest. Baseline AMPS was statistically significantly associated with age-matched ADL ability six months after cardiac arrest (ORadjusted 5.5, 95%CI: 1.5;10.0), and personal ADL-I (VAS: βadjusted = 3.00, 95%CI: 1.3;4.6/index score: βadjusted = 0.03, 95%CI 0.01;0.05) and MoCA (index: βadjusted = -0.09, 95%CI: -0.2;-0.02) with HRQoL. The association between MoCA and return to work one-year after cardiac arrest showed an OR of 3.0 (95%CI: 0.5;9.0), although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions Decreased ADL ability at hospital discharge was associated with poorer post-discharge outcomes in OHCA survivors, while cognitive screening was also associated with certain aspects of recovery.",

Early prediction can guide tailored treatment. We evaluated whether early clinical measures predict long-term outcomes.\nMETHODS: In a longitudinal multicenter cohort study, we prospectively included patients who regained consciousness after cardiac arrest. Potential predictors during hospitalization were scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Barthel Index, and presence of delirium and transient coma >24 h. These were related to cognitive function (MoCA), emotional distress (HADS), and health-related QoL (EQ-5D-5L) at twelve months using multivariate mixed-effects models, with age and sex as covariates. Likelihood ratios were calculated for cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26).\nRESULTS: We included 100 patients; 20 % showed cognitive impairment at twelve months and 8 % and 10 % showed signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. Early MoCA showed a borderline significant positive relation with twelve-month MoCA (β = 0.21, p = 0.05). The likelihood ratio for early MoCA < 26 predicting cognitive impairment at twelve months was LR+ 1.29 (95 % CI: 0.40-4.20) and LR- 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.18-1.94). Early HADS was associated with twelve-month HADS (β = 0.47, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.60, p < 0.001), with age negatively associated (β = -0.10, 95 % CI: -0.18 to -0.02, p = 0.019). No other significant relations were found.\nCONCLUSION: MoCA and HADS scores during hospitalization relate to long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes after cardiac arrest. These measures may help identify patients who could benefit from cognitive rehabilitation or psychosocial support.",

OHCA survivors from participating sites were contacted 5-8 years post OHCA. Survival rates were collected from medical registries. Telephone interviews were performed to collect basic outcomes and quality of life. Questionnaires surveyed patients and relatives levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep, fatigue, cognitive decline and everyday life participation.\nRESULTS: 279 patients were included at the participating sites, 161 (58%) were still alive. A vast majority of the participating survivors (97.8%) had favourable outcomes (CPC 1-2) and quality of life was comparable to the background population. Among the participating OHCA survivors, 5.5% met the criteria for anxiety, 2.7% for depression, 4.5% for PTSD, 24.5% reported sleep problems, 45.5% reported fatigue, and 40.7% were working full- or part-time. Among the participating relatives, 7.0% met the criteria for anxiety, 1.2% for depression, 3.5% for PTSD, and 52.3% of the relatives reported that the patient had suffered cognitive decline post OHCA. ROSC delay, higher age, and female sex were negatively associated with several long-term outcomes. Treatment allocation was not associated with better outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term OHCA survivors had acceptable outcomes, though self-reported sleep and fatigue problems and relatives-reported cognitive decline were prevalent. Higher age and longer ROSC delay were risk factors of poorer outcome, primarily driven by mortality. Female sex was a risk factor of worse self-reported outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01689077.",

Advances in resuscitation and post-resuscitation care have improved survival, precipitating greater scientific interest in OHCA patients' survivorship. However, there is insufficient high-quality population-based long-term survivorship data and limited research on the impact of OHCA sequelae on survivors' caregivers.\nOBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to determine neurological function, physical, psychological, cognitive, social outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of OHCA survivors in Singapore. Secondary aims are to quantify caregivers' burden and its association with their HRQoL, and psychological well-being.\nMETHODS: The Quality Cardiac Arrest Survivorship Cohort Study (QualiCAS) is a prospective population-based cohort study of OHCA survivors and their caregivers in Singapore. Participants aged ≥18 years and caregivers aged ≥21 years will be recruited from all public hospitals in Singapore. Health outcomes will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and 3 and 5 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Fatigue Severity Scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool, EQ-5D-5L, Community Integration Questionnaire-Revised, Barthel Index, Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Timed Up and Go Test, Handgrip strength assessment, and Zarit Burden Interview.\nDISCUSSION: This study allows us to understand the natural history of OHCA survivorship and quantify the burdens on patients and their caregivers. Findings can guide clinical follow-up, identify high-risk patients, intervention targets, and inform rehabilitation strategies for OHCA sequelae.",

The aims were to determine 1) the prevalence of PTG, and 2) the influence of survivor characteristics during hospitalization on levels of PTG at follow-up in a Danish cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors.\nMETHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study including OHCA survivors, exploring soci-odemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics using the Montreal Cognitive Assess-ment (MoCA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Crisis Support Scale (CSS) during hospitalization. At three-month follow-up, structured interviews were conducted to assess PTG at personal, relational, and institutional levels. The influence of survivor characteristics on PTG was explored using Pearson's chi-square tests.\nRESULTS: Overall, 173 survivors were included. At follow-up, 87% of survivors reported hav-ing one or more levels of PTG. The analysis revealed that the absence of cognitive impairment (MoCA ≥ 26 vs. MoCA < 26) was associated with personal growth ( = 0.02), being younger (<58 years vs. ≥ 58 years) with relational growth ( = 0.03) and being female or having symp-toms of depression (HADS ≥ 8 vs. HADS < 8), with institutional growth ( = 0.02 and = 0.04), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The OHCA survivors reported high levels of PTG at three-month follow-up. The type of PTG level was influenced by the absence of cognitive impairment, younger age, fe-male sex, and symptoms of depression during hospitalisation. Social support, symptoms of anxiety, and traumatic distress did not significantly influence the level of PTG.",

Feasibility outcomes were feasibility of recruitment, assessments, adherence; acceptability outcomes were satisfaction, credibility, expectancy. Dyads completed pre- and post-test psychosocial measures and participated in exit interviews. We calculated frequencies and proportions of our outcomes, conducted exploratory paired t-tests to examine initial signals of changes in psychosocial measures, and performed explanatory-sequential mixed methods to integrate data sources.\nRESULTS: We screened 12 dyads and enrolled 7. RT-CA exceeded most feasibility and acceptability benchmarks (>70 % on 7 of 8). In exploratory analyses, participants experienced preliminary, yet meaningful reductions in emotional distress (HADS anxiety survivors: mean [95 % CI] = -5.4 [-3.4, -7.5], p < 0.001; depression survivors = -5.1 [-2.2, -8], p < 0.01; anxiety caregivers = -3.1 [-0.8, -5.5], p < 0.05; depression caregivers = -3.5 [-8, 1.1], p > 0.05). Mixed-methods analysis indicated general concordance between quantitative and qualitative data.\nCONCLUSION: Results support preliminary feasibility of RT-CA. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial is now required.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT06517394.",

However, no definitive data are available on this topic, so this study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional screening system for OHCA survivors in Italy and the prevalence of these disorders.: OHCA survivors discharged with good neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ≤ 2 and modified Ranking Scale (mRS) ≤ 3) from hospitals in the \"Lombardia CARe\" registry will be evaluated by a clinical psychologist using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EQ-5D-5L for quality of life, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) at pre-discharge or within 15 days and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients with clinical issues will be referred for psychological support or to a community rehabilitation program. Feasibility will be defined as a recruitment rate ≥ 80% and acceptability as a retention rate ≥ 50% over 12 months.: Based on historical data from the Lombardia CARe, an estimated 350 eligible survivors are expected, which will allow estimation of a prevalence ranging between 20% and 30% with 5% precision and 95% confidence.: This study will be the first in Italy to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, sub-regional system for pre-/post-discharge evaluation of cognitive impairment, mental health, and quality of life in a large cohort of OHCA survivors, documenting the prevalence of these disorders.",

Data were generated through nine in-depth, in-person or virtual semistructured interviews conducted with volunteer responders.\nSETTING: The study was conducted in Denmark. We recruited volunteer responders from all of Denmark enrolled in the nationwide volunteer responder programme.\nPARTICIPANTS: Nine volunteer responders who were dispatched in response to a POHCA from 2020 to 2023 were included in the study.\nRESULTS: The experiences of attending a POHCA were categorised into three key themes: the mission, the situation and the aftermath. The mission refers to the altruistic drive of volunteer responders to contribute to life-saving efforts. The situation reflects the profound shock experienced when volunteer responders realise that the patient is a child, alongside their ability to act decisively and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the situation. The aftermath reveals the deep sense of fulfilment derived from being present and actively involved in attempting to save a child's life, as well as the various emotions and reactions that the volunteer responders process after the event.\nCONCLUSION: Attending a POHCA is a profoundly intense experience that can leave an emotional impact on the volunteer responders. On arriving at the location, despite the initial shock upon realising that the patient is a child, the volunteer responders engage in the resuscitation attempt and offer support to the child's family. However, alerting the volunteer responders beforehand that the patient is a child may help mitigate the initial shock. Volunteer responders find significant meaning in their roles and express a strong commitment to saving lives, irrespective of the age of those in need.",

Nevertheless, the relationship between PICS-relevant domains in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and psychological distress in their family members (henceforth, PICS-F) remains underexplored.: We enrolled consecutive CA patients admitted between 16 August 2021 and 28 June 2023 to an academic medical center, along with their close family members, in prospective studies. Survivors' PICS domains were: physical dependence (Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, PSMS), cognitive impairments (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-M), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS) symptoms (PTSD Checklist-PCL 5), as well as PICS-F (PCL-5 Total Score). Hierarchical multivariate linear regressions examined associations between PICS-F and survivors' PICS domains.: Of 74 dyads (= 148), survivors had a mean () age of 56 ± 16 years, with 61% being male and with a median hospital stay of 28 days. Family members (43% spouses) were slightly younger (52 ± 14 years), predominantly female (72%), and of minority race/ethnicity (62%). A high prevalence of PICS assessed 28.5 days (interquartile range 10-63) post-CA was observed in survivors (78% physical dependence, 54% cognitive impairment, 30% PTSS) and in family members (30% PTSS). Survivor PTSS was significantly associated with family member distress (= 0.3,= 0.02), independent of physical dependence (= 0.0,= 0.9), cognitive impairment (= -0.1,= 0.5), family member characteristics, and duration of hospitalization.: Both CA survivors and their family members showed substantial evidence of likely PICS. Survivor PTSS is notably associated with family member distress, highlighting the need for dyadic interventions to enhance psychosocial outcomes.",

Thus, the objectives were to i) describe differences in self-reported mental well-being, mental health, and caregiver strain at different time points (1-5 years) post-OHCA and ii) investigate characteristics associated with caregiver strain.\nMETHODS: A national cross-sectional survey (DANCAS) from October 2020 to March 2021 with OHCA survivors and their closest relatives. The relative survey included the WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (M-CSI). Differences in scores between time groups were explored using descriptive statistics. Associations between characteristics and caregiver strain were investigated with multivariable logistic regression models, presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for gender, age, education status, relative affiliation, and time after OHCA.\nRESULTS: Of 561 relatives, 24% (n = 137) experienced caregiver strain, with no significant differences in the relatives' mental well-being, mental health, or caregiver strain with time since OHCA. In the adjusted analyses, older age (OR 0.98 95% CI 0.96;0.99) and several self-reported outcomes, including reduced mental well-being (WHO-5 OR 7.27 95% CI 4.86;11.52), symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A OR 6.01 95% CI 3.89;9.29) and depression (HADS-D OR 15.03 95% CI 7.33;30.80) were significantly associated with worse caregiver strain.\nCONCLUSION: Nearly one-quarter of relatives of OHCA survivors experience caregiver strain, with this proportion remaining unchanged with time. Several outcomes were associated with caregiver strain, emphasising the need to identify relatives at greater risk of burden following OHCA.",

We quantified emotional distress using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 and PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 4a; perceived social support using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; functional dependence using the modified Rankin Scale; and cognitive impairment using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Our primary outcome was readiness for discharge, measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale. We used multivariable linear regression to test the independent association of each survivorship factor and readiness for discharge.\nRESULTS: We included 110 patients (64% male, 88% white, mean age 59 [standard deviation ± 13.1 years]). Emotional distress, functional dependence, and social support were independently associated with readiness for discharge (adjusted β's [absolute value]: 0.25-0.30, all p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems should consider implementing routine in-hospital screening for emotional distress, social support, and functional dependence for CA survivors who are awake, alert and approaching hospital discharge, and prioritize brief in hospital treatment or post-discharge referrals.",

At three months, four subtests of the performance-based Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) (Trail making, Color-word interference, Verbal fluency, and Figure design), the patient-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult (BRIEF-A), and the observer-reported 16-item Short Form (SF) Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline after Cardiac Arrest (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) were collected. Spearman's rank coefficient correlation analysis was performed to examine correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A, and SF-16 IQCODE-CA.\nRESULTS: Overall, 21% of survivors exhibited impairment in executive functioning using the D-KEFS subtest Color-word interference, while only 9% self-reported executive impairment (BRIEF-A) and 7% of relatives reported cognitive decline (SF-16 IQCODE-CA) in survivors at three months post-arrest. All correlations between D-KEFS, BRIEF-A and SF-16 IQCODE-CA were negligible to low.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this REVIVAL substudy suggest that although the performance-based and reported measures did not correlate, dual neurocognitive screening tools containing both a self-reported and an informant-reported version may have the potential to detect executive discrepancies in the return to everyday life and guide targeted neurorehabilitation after OHCA.",

    "abstract": "Long-term cognitive impairment is common in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening to identify patients at risk is recommended. Functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) holds potential to contribute to prediction of cognitive outcomes. In this study, we investigated the possible value of early changes in resting-state networks for predicting short and long-term cognitive functioning of cardiac arrest survivors. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in cardiac arrest survivors in three Dutch hospitals. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired within a month after cardiac arrest. We primarily focused on functional connectivity within the default-mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN), and additionally explored functional connectivity in seven other networks. Cognitive outcome was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during hospital admission and at 3 and 12 months, and by neuropsychological examination (NPE) at 12 months. We tested mixed effects models to evaluate the value of connectivity within the networks for predicting global cognitive outcomes at the three time points, and long-term cognitive outcomes in the memory, attention, and executive functioning domains. We included 80 patients (age 60 ± 11 years, 72 (90%) male). MoCA scores increased significantly between hospital admission and 3 months (ΔMoCA = 2.89, p < 0.01), but not between 3 and 12 months (ΔMoCA = 0.38, p = 0.52). Connectivity within the DMN, SN, and dorsal attention network (DAN) was positively related to global cognitive functioning during hospital admission (β = 0.85, p = 0.03; β = 1.48, p < 0.01; β = 0.96, p = 0.01), but not at 3 and 12 months. Network connectivity was also unrelated to long-term memory, attention, or executive functioning. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN, SN, and DAN measured in the first month after cardiac arrest is related to short-term global, but not long-term global or domain-specific cognitive performance of survivors. These results do not support the value of functional connectivity within these RSNs for prediction of long-term cognitive performance after cardiac arrest.",

    "abstract": "AIM: Around six percent of comatose patients after cardiac arrest have a Cerebral Performance Categories score of three (CPC3) at six months after the arrest, classified as severe neurological disability. There is limited knowledge regarding the likelihood of further recovery in the cognitive, emotional, and quality of life domains. We aimed to estimate the probability of recovery towards independency.\nMETHODS: From a prospective Registry on comatose cardiac arrest patients admitted between 2013 and 2017 in two Dutch hospitals, we included patients with a CPC3 at six months after cardiac arrest. We followed patients up to November 2023. The primary outcome measure was the CPC score at time of follow up. Secondary outcomes were scores on questionnaires on cognition, mood, and quality of life according to the minimal dataset of acquired brain injury.\nRESULTS: In our cohort of 667 patients, 29 (4.3%) had a CPC3 score at six months (median age 68 years, 83% male). At a median time of eight years after cardiac arrest, sixteen patients had died. Twelve of thirteen alive patients still had a CPC3 score (92%) and one a CPC2 (8%). Seven patients agreed with further interviewing, one showed independency in activities of daily living (14%). Six patients (86%) reported limitations due to physical and one (14%) due to emotional problems. All had severe cognitive impairment. Six (86%) missed cognitive rehabilitation.\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows that while the probability of recovery towards independence for patients with severe neurological disability at six months after cardiac arrest is limited, most long-term survivors are satisfied with their quality of life.",

Learning about the long-term outcomes is very important for developing prognostication guidelines, improving post-cardiac care, counseling caregivers about the future of their child, and creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention studies to improve outcomes. Few PICUs worldwide provide a multidisciplinary follow-up program as routine practice at an outpatient clinic with standardized measurements, using validated instruments including neuropsychological assessments by psychologists. The primary goal of such a follow-up program should be to provide excellent care to children and their caregivers, thereby resulting in a high attendance. Pediatric psychologists, neurologists and pediatricians/pediatric intensivists should ideally be involved to screen for delayed development and psychosocial problems and offer appropriate care at the same time. Preferably, outcomes should consist of evaluation of morbidity (physical and neuropsychological), functional health and Health Related Quality Of Life (QoL) of the patient and their caregivers.",

This study describes long-term observer-reported cognitive decline among Danish OHCA survivors, including differences in years since the event, and investigates characteristics and self-reported outcomes associated with observer-reported cognitive decline.\nMETHODS: Adults who survived an OHCA from 2016 to 2019, and their relatives, completed the national DANish Cardiac Arrest Survivorship survey. Relatives completed the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the World Health Organisation-Five Well-being index; and survivors completed the Two Simple Questions (everyday activities and mental recovery), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, HADS, and the Short World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Potential associations between survivor characteristics and the IQCODE-CA were investigated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Self-reported outcomes among survivors and relatives, and the association with IQCODE-CA scores were investigated using separate logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Total median IQCODE-CA score was 3.04 (IQR: 3.00-3.27), with 47% having possible cognitive decline (score ≥ 3.04), consistent across time groups. Increasing age (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) and worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes for survivors and relatives, except 'everyday activities' were significantly associated with possible cognitive decline among survivors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of OHCA survivors may suffer long-term cognitive decline. Worse self-reported mental and physical outcomes among survivors and their relatives are associated with potential cognitive decline emphasising the need for post-OHCA care to include systematic neurocognitive assessment, tailored support and effective rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cognitive function is often impaired for cardiac arrest (CA) survivors due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Whether cognitive impairment at hospital discharge is associated with recovery defined as functional status and fatigue measured at 1-month post-discharge is not known.\nMETHODS: Consecutive CA patients admitted at an academic center (May 14, 2021-June 23, 2023) were assessed for cognitive impairment (modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-m < 33) and depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire) at hospital discharge. Poor functional status (primary outcome; modified Rankin Scale, mRS > 3) and fatigue severity (patient-reported outcome; Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) were assessed 1-month post-discharge. Hierarchical regressions tested associations of cognitive function with outcomes.\nRESULTS: Of 112 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 14.8; 38% female; 43% White race, 20% Black race, 29% Hispanic ethnicity) completing discharge TICS-m, 63 (56%) had indicated cognitive impairment, and 68 (61%) had poor 1-month functional outcome. Worse discharge cognitive function was independently associated with a higher risk of poor 1-month functional outcome (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02) after adjusting for age, education, sex, race, ethnicity, length of hospital stay, comorbidities, and depressive symptoms. Fatigue severity lacked significant associations with cognitive function, but was associated with depressive symptoms (B = 1.03 [0.00, 2.05], p = 0.04).\nCONCLUSION: Cognitive function at discharge after CA was significantly and independently associated with functional outcome 1 month after hospital discharge. Psychological distress contributed to fatigue severity. This highlights the need for screening and addressing cognitive and emotional problems pre-hospital discharge.",

The objective of this study was to assess components of return to work among OHCA survivors.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the French national multicentric cohort AfterRosc to include OHCA survivors admitted between April 1st 2021 and March 31st 2022, discharged alive from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and who were less than 65 years old. A phone-call interview was performed one year after OHCA to assess return to work, level of education, former level of occupation as well as neurological recovery. Geographic and socio-economic data from the patient's residential neighborhoods were also collected. Comparisons were performed between patients who returned to work and those who did not, using non-parametric tests.\nRESULTS: Of the 251 patients included in the registry, 86 were alive at ICU discharge and 31 patients that worked prior to the OHCA were included for analysis. Seventeen survivors returned to work after a median delay of 112 days [92-157] Among them, nine (53%) had required initial work adjustments. Overall, only 6 patients (19%) had returned to work ad integrum. Higher educational level, work which required higher competence-level, higher income, living in a better socio-economical neighborhood, as well as better scores on all three standardized MPAI-4 score components (abilities, adjustment and participation) were significantly associated with return to work. Participants that had not returned to work had a significant drop of income (p = 0.0025).\nCONCLUSION: In this prospective study regarding French OHCA survivors, return to work is associated with better socio-economical individual and environmental status, as well as better scores on all MPAI-4 components.",

HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). In total, 1,278 IHCA survivors were included in the study, 3-6 months after the cardiac arrest (CA). Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The comorbidities analysed in this study were the patients' status for diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, respiratory insufficiency, and heart failure.\nRESULTS: Overall, the IHCA survivors reported high levels of HRQoL, but there was great variation within the population, e.g., EQ VAS median (q1-q3) = 70 (50-80). Survivors with one or more comorbidities reported worse HRQoL in 6 out of 8 outcomes (p < 0.001). All studied comorbidities were each associated with worse HRQoL, but no comorbidity was associated with every outcome measure. Previous stroke and respiratory insufficiency were significantly associated with every outcome measure except for HADS Anxiety. The linear regression models explained 4-8% of the total variance in HRQoL (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Since IHCA survivors with comorbidities report worse HRQoL compared to those without comorbidities, it is important to pay directed attention to them when developing and providing post-CA care, especially in those with respiratory insufficiency and previous stroke.",

However, experiences of caring for an OHCA survivor are sparsely described. Thus, this study aimed to explore how family caregivers of OHCA survivors experience the potential burden.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using an explorative qualitative approach, six focus group interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 family caregivers of OHCA survivors and analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach inspired by the philosophy of Ricoeur. The OHCA survivors attended a rehabilitation course, and the family caregivers were interviewed as part of the course.Based on the analysis, three themes emerged: (i) feeling unexpectedly alone and invisible; the family caregivers experienced an emotional burden that could not be shared-leading to caregiving being a lonely experience, (ii) fear of loss; the fear of losing a loved one was a constant companion contributing to the burden, and (iii) adjusting to a new everyday life; the family caregivers had difficulties adjusting to living their lives on the premise of the survivors' needs.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study emphasize the burden experienced by family caregivers and how they can be trapped in competing emotions and tensions. The possible caregiver burden following OHCA should be acknowledged. Interventions to reduce the burden should be tested and implemented as part of the clinical care of OHCA survivors and their families.",

At three-month follow-up, we evaluated cognitive impairment with a neuropsychological test battery and symptoms of psychopathology were re-assessed using HADS and IES-R. Logistic regression models were applied to examine associations between screening results and outcomes.\nRESULTS: This study included 297 OHCA survivors. During hospitalisation, 65% presented with cognitive impairment, 25% reported symptoms of anxiety, 20% symptoms of depression and 21% symptoms of traumatic distress. At follow-up, 53% reported cognitive impairment, 17% symptoms of anxiety, 15% symptoms of depression and 19% symptoms of traumatic distress. Cognitive impairment during hospitalisation was associated with higher odds (OR (95% CI) 2.55 (1.36-4.75), p = .02) of an unfavorable cognitive outcome at follow-up, and symptoms of psychopathology during hospitalisation were associated with higher odds of psychopathology at follow-up across all three symptom groups; anxiety (6.70 (2.40-18.72), p < .001), depression (4.69 (1.69-13.02), p < .001) and traumatic distress (7.07 (2.67-18.73), p < .001).\nCONCLUSION: OHCA survivors exhibited both cognitive impairment and symptoms of psychopathology during hospitalisation comparable to previous studies, which were associated with unfavorable mental health outcomes at three-month follow-up.",

Caregivers are important in the survivor's recovery, yet there is little research specifically focused on their experiences once the survivor is discharged home. In this study, we highlight how caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors described and experienced their caregiver role, the strategies they used to fulfill their role, and the additional needs they still have years after the IHCA event. Methods and Results Between March and July 2019, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 12 caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors. Interviews were transcribed, and content analysis was performed. Patterns within the data were further analyzed and grouped into themes. A predominant theme of \"disruption\" was identified across 3 different domains including the following: (1) disruption in caregiver's life, (2) disruption in caregiver-patient relationship, and (3) disruption in caregiver's well-being. Disruption was associated with both positive and negative caregiver experiences. Strategies caregivers used and resources they felt would have helped them adjust to their caregiver role were also identified. Conclusions Caregivers for veteran IHCA survivors experienced a disruption in many facets of their lives. Caregivers felt the veterans' IHCA impacted various aspects of their lives, and they continued to need additional support in order to care for the IHCA survivor and themselves. Although some were able to procure coping strategies, such as counseling and engaging in stress-relieving activities, most indicated additional help and resources were still needed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insomnia symptoms seem to be common in cardiac arrest survivors but their associations with important outcomes such as self-reported health and life satisfaction have not previously been reported during the early post-event period. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether symptoms of insomnia are associated with self-reported health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors six months after the event.\nMETHODS: This multicentre cross-sectional survey included cardiac arrest survivors ≥18 years. Participants were recruited six months after the event from five hospitals in southern Sweden, and completed a questionnaire including the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale, EQ-5D-5L, Health Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, linear regression, and ordinal logistic regression. The regression analyses were adjusted for demographic and medical factors.\nRESULTS: In total, 212 survivors, 76.4% males, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD = 11.9) were included, and of those, 20% reported clinical insomnia. Insomnia was significantly associated with all aspects of self-reported health ( < 0.01) and life satisfaction ( < 0.001), except mobility ( = 0.093), self-care ( = 0.676), and usual activities ( = 0.073).\nCONCLUSION: Insomnia plays a potentially important role for both health and life satisfaction in cardiac arrest survivors. Screening for sleep problems should be part of post cardiac arrest care and follow-up to identify those in need of further medical examination and treatment.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most cardiac arrest (CA) survivors report good health and quality of life. Life satisfaction on the other hand has not yet been studied in a large scale in the CA population. We aimed to explore life satisfaction as perceived by CA survivors with three research questions addressed: (1) how do CA survivors report their life satisfaction, (2) how are different domains of life satisfaction associated with overall life satisfaction, and (3) how are demographic and medical factors associated with overall life satisfaction?\nMETHODS: This registry study had a cross-sectional design. Life satisfaction was assessed using the 11-item Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11). The sample included 1435 survivors ≥18 years of age. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were used.\nRESULTS: Survivors were most satisfied with partner relation (85.6%), family life (82.2%), and self-care (77.8%), while 60.5% were satisfied with overall life. Satisfaction with psychological health was strongest associated with overall life satisfaction. Among medical and demographic factors, female sex and poor cerebral performance were associated with less overall life satisfaction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Generally, CA survivors seem to perceive similar levels of overall life satisfaction as general populations, while survivors tend to be significantly less satisfied with their sexual life. Satisfaction with psychological health is of special interest to identify and treat. Additionally, female survivors and survivors with poor neurological outcome are at risk for poorer overall life satisfaction and need special attention by healthcare professionals.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Allocating resources to increase survival after cardiac arrest requires survivors to have a good quality of life, but long-term data are lacking.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the quality of life of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2001 to 2019.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used the EuroQol Health Questionnaire, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the health-related quality of life of all adult survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest included in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry between June 1, 2001, and August 31, 2019, who were alive in October 2020 (follow-up periods, 0-1, >1-2, >2-4, >4-6, >6-8, >8-10, >10-15, and >15-20 years since arrest). The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.\nEXPOSURE: All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.\nRESULTS: Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively. Health-related quality of life was similar in survivor groups across all follow-up periods.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among this survey study's responders, who comprised more than 50% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark, long-term health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high and comparable to that of the general population. These findings support resource allocation and efforts targeted to increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study with a total of 97 patients. We evaluated cognitive dysfunction via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Alzheimer's disease-8 mood disorders via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We measured quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Levels questionnaire. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders were common among patients with good neurologic recovery. There were 23 patients who experienced cognitive impairments (23.7%) and 28 who suffered from mood disorders (28.9%). Age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12), mood disorders (adjusted OR 22.80, 95% CI 4.84-107.49) and hospital length of stay (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive impairments (adjusted OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.83-35.97) and non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 11.51, 95% CI 3.15-42.15) were risk factors for mood disorders. Quality of life was significantly lower in the OHCA survivors with each disorder than the healthy individuals. Routine screening and intervention are needed for OHCA survivors.",

Data collection and analysis using the seven stages of hermeneutic analysis described by Diekelman. Data were collected through semi-structured personal interviews with open-ended questions.\nRESULTS: Analysis revealed five themes: 'The unexpected attack', 'Experiencing a different world: Transformation of Body, Time, Emotion and Sensation', 'Restoration of the re-embodied self', 'Life transformation' and 'Personal transformation'. The themes are commensurate with transcultural components of Near-Death Experiences. Surviving out of hospital cardiac arrest was perceived as a 'divine gift' and a chance to continue 'living in a more conscious and meaningful way'. Despite participants' physical and psychosocial challenges, the narratives highlighted a newly acquired deep appreciation for the joy of life, living and others. Construction of meaning and a heightened spirituality seem central in reconstructing life after out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors.\nPATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors reflected and described in-depth on their lived experiences of out of hospital cardiac arrest through a 60- to 90-min interview. In addition, the participants provided their feedback on the interpretation of the findings, confirmed the study findings, and ensured that the analysis reflected aspects of their individual experiences and were true to them.",

To address this critical practice gap, we plan a mixed-methods study to co-produce and evaluate a new cardiac arrest-specific patient/survivor-reported outcome measure (PROM).\nMETHODS: International guidelines have informed a two-stage, iterative, and interactive process.Stage one will establish what is important to measure following cardiac arrest. A meta-ethnography of published qualitative research and a qualitative exploration of the experiences of survivors and their key supporters will inform the development of a measurement framework. This will be supplemented by existing, extensive reviews describing concepts that have previously been measured in this population. Focus groups with survivors, key supporters, and healthcare professionals, followed by further interviews with survivors and key supporters, will inform the iterative refinement of the framework, candidate items, and PROM structure.Stage two will involve a psychometric evaluation following completion by a large cohort of survivors. Measurement theory will inform: the identification of items that best measure important outcomes; item reduction; and provide robust evidence of measurement and practical properties.\nDISCUSSION: An international, collaborative approach to PROM development will engage survivors, key supporters, researchers, and health professionals from study commencement. Successful co-production of the cardiac arrest survivorship and health-related quality of life (CASHQoL) measure will provide a robust, relevant, and internationally applicable measure, suitable for completion by adult survivors, and integration into research, registries, and routine care settings.Ethical approval: University of Warwick Biomedical & Scientific Research Ethics Committee (BSREC 22/20-21 granted 10/11/20).",

Hence, we investigated these problems in survivors 1-5 years post-OHCA and whether the results are different at different time points post-OHCA.\nMETHODS: All adults who survived an OHCA in Denmark from 2016 to 2019 were identified using the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry and invited to participate in a survey between October 2020 and March 2021. The survey included the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, \"Two simple questions\" (everyday activities and mental recovery), and the 12-item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. To investigate results at different time points, survivors were divided into four time-groups (12-24, 25-36, 37-48 and 49-56 months post-OHCA). Differences between time-groups were determined using the Kruskall-Wallis test for the mean scores and Chi-square test for the proportion of survivors with symptoms.\nRESULTS: Total eligible survey population was 2116, of which 1258 survivors (60 %) responded. Overall, 29 % of survivors reported fatigue, 20 % anxiety, 15 % depression, and 27 % disability. When survivors were sub-divided by time since OHCA, no significant difference was found on either means scores or proportion between time groups (p = 0.28 to 0.88).\nCONCLUSION: Up to a third of survivors report fatigue, anxiety, depression, reduced mental function and disability 1-5 years after OHCA. This proportion is the same regardless of how much time has passed supporting early screening and tailored post-OHCA interventions to help survivors adapt to their new situation.",

Seven studies were included, and amongst patients that survived to hospital discharge or to 30 days, longer-term survival was at least 95% at 24 months of follow up. A highly variable proportion (range 10-71%) of patients had favorable neurological outcomes at 24 months of follow up. With regard to health-related quality of life outcomes, at a time point distal to 1 year, at least 60% of pediatric non-traumatic OHCA patients were reported to have good outcomes. Our study found that at least 95% of pediatric OHCA patients, who survived to discharge, survived to a time point distal to 1 year. There is a general paucity of data surrounding the pediatric OHCA population.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Few studies have focused on mid/long-term neurological changes in out-of- hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. Some studies suggest that there is still a slow, small, progressive improvement in cognitive function and quality of life for this population, even in the mid/long term. However, clinical data focused on mid/long-term outcomes for OHCA patients are still lacking. This study aimed to assess mid-term neurological changes in OHCA patients. We summarized patients' improved or worsened neurological changes between 30 and 90 days. Then we identified the relationship between clinical variables and 30- to 90-day neurological improvement.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of data (Jun 2014 - Dec 2017) from a Japanese nationwide OHCA registry was conducted. Inclusion criteria were OHCA patients ≥18 years old. Exclusion criteria were death within 30 days and missing Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 30 and 90 days. We described the distributions of 30-day and 90-day CPC scores as well as the number and portion of patients whose CPC scores improved and worsened between 30 and 90 days. Additionally, factors affecting improved neurological changes over the time period were examined using multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of the registry's 34,745 patients, 1868 were analyzed. Favorable neurological outcomes (CPC scores of 1 and 2) were seen in 1020/1868 patients at 90 days. CPC scores at 90 days were: CPC 1: 866 (46%), CPC 2: 154 (8.2%), CPC 3: 224 (12%), and CPC 4: 392 (20%), respectively. A total of 232 patients (CPC 5: 12%) died between 30 and 90 days. In 133 patients (7%), 90-day CPC scores improved compared to their 30-day scores. In 260 patients (14%), 90-day CPC scores worsened compared with their 30-day scores. Application of target temperature management was an independent factor for 30- to 90-day neurological improvement (adjusted odds ratio: 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.68).\nCONCLUSIONS: In our nationwide registry, 7% of resuscitated patients had improved neurological changes in the 30- to 90-day period; most of the improvements were CPC scores improving from 2 to 1. Target temperature management was an independent factor associated with CPC improvement over the 30- to 90-day period.",

At discharge, 60% were on paid sick leave, and 20% at 12 months. Age (per one year older) increased the odds of experiencing the composite endpoint at 3 and 12 months (3 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.10, 12 months: OR 1.06 95%CI 1.03-1.09) among the total population (n = 184). Self-reported health at discharge was not associated with the endpoint.\nCONCLUSION: One-fifth of the OHCA survivors at a working-age prior to the OHCA was still on paid sick leave after 12 months. Increasing age was the only characteristic associated with a composite endpoint of prolonged sick leave or leaving the workforce at 3 and 12 months after discharge. With increasing survival rates, healthcare professionals need to support the population in resuming daily life, including returning to the workforce, when relevant.",

Understanding their experiences provides a basis to study tools and interventions to improve short- and long-term recovery and rehabilitation.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Qualitative interview and survey-style studies explored the lived experience of SCA survivors and revealed common themes (e.g., need for recovery expectations and long-term follow-up resources). A heightened awareness for the unique needs of family and loved ones of survivors led to qualitative studies focusing on these members as well. Methodology papers published portend prospective assessment and follow-up cohort studies. However, no investigations evaluating discharge processes or specific interventions directed at domain impairments common after SCA were identified in the review period. International work continues to identify patient and family-centered priorities for outcome measurement and research.\nSUMMARY: In line with increased recognition of the importance for recovery and rehabilitation after SCA, there has been a commensurate increase in investigations documenting the needs of survivors and families surviving SCA. Pediatric and underserved populations continue to be understudied with regards to recovery after SCA.",

Participants provided demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models.\nRESULTS: We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (β: -0.35 to -0.53, p < .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in survivors and informal caregivers. Further study is needed to validate these findings in a larger, representative sample.",

Caregivers of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were used as controls.\nMETHODS: Data were collected from the cognitive substudy of the Targeted Temperature Management-trial. Caregiver burden was assessed with the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview, with scores ≤20 considered as no burden. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF-36v2®, with T-scores 47-53 representing the norm. Cardiac arrest survivors were categorized based on the results from cognitive assessments as having \"no cognitive impairment\" or \"cognitive impairment\".\nRESULTS: Follow-up 6 months post event was performed for caregivers of 272 cardiac arrest survivors and 108 matched myocardial infarction controls, included at an intended ratio of 2:1. In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and controls reported similar caregiver burden. The overall scores for quality of life were within normative levels and similar for caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and control patients. Compared to those with no cognitive impairment, caregivers of cognitively impaired cardiac arrest survivors (n = 126) reported higher levels of burden (median 18 versus 8, p < 0.001) and worse quality of life in five of eight domains, particularly \"Role-Emotional\" (mean 45.7 versus 49.5, p = 0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and myocardial infarction controls reported similar levels of burden and quality of life.

To adjust to and manage daily life is critical, and therefore a tailored rehabiliation programme was introduced to the participants. The study aimed to explore the lived experience among cardiac arrest survivors.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Data were gathered through six focus group interviews during a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. Thirty-three out-of-hospital SCA survivors (8 women and 25 men) participated. Time since cardiac arrest was on average 12-57 months. An exploratory qualitative design inspired by Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutics was applied. Two main themes emerged from the analysis and interpretation: (i) a lack of support from the health system in the transition from hospital to daily life; and (ii) feeling understood for the first time. The findings revealed that out-of-hospital SCA survivors experience a knowledge gap struggling for support. Attending the programme, gaining knowledge and experiencing peer support was described as a revelation for them.\nCONCLUSION: The findings suggest that out-of-hospital SCA survivors felt understood for the first time when attending a cardiac arrest rehabilitation programme. A post-arrest pathway is needed led by a coordinating cardiac arrest specialist nursing service together with allied healthcare professionals. Focus on hypoxic brain injuries, emotional burdens, and supportive strategies are essential in the transition to daily life. Facilitated peer support is warranted.",

We conducted an online survey study between October 29, 2019, and November 15, 2019 with cardiac arrest survivors and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. We queried survivors as to whether they experienced cognitive or psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. Next, we queried both survivors and caregivers on the provision of resources through three metrics: (1) discussions with providers about potential cognitive or psychological symptoms, (2) neurologist or psychologist appointments scheduled by providers, and (3) mental health referrals by providers. We then ran Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to compare the proportion of survivors and caregivers who reported resource provision (observed values) to the proportion of survivors who reported experiencing cognitive and psychological symptoms, respectively (expected values). We included responses from 167 survivors and 52 caregivers. A total of 73.1% ( = 122) survivors reported experiencing cognitive symptoms and 67.1% ( = 112) psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. When compared to these two proportions, provision of resources was significantly lower in all three metrics: (1) fewer discussions with providers about potential for developing cognitive symptoms (31%) and psychological symptoms (26.3%), (2) fewer neurologist appointments scheduled (8.4%) and psychologist appointments scheduled (4.8%), and (3) fewer referrals to mental health (6%). Informal caregivers also reported significantly lower provision of resources in all three metrics, with the exception of discussions about developing cognitive symptoms. Our results suggest that there are discrepancies in the provision of cognitive and psychological resources in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery. Systematic referral processes may be needed to standardize resource provision to consistently meet the pervasive cognitive and psychological needs of cardiac arrest survivors.",

Survival rates have increased over the last decade and many survivors return to their communities. IHCA has been recognized as a unique disease entity because the arrest happens in a medical care setting and survivors often have more medical co-morbidities. Although more individuals are surviving IHCA, very little is known about their long-term recovery experiences. Semi-structured interviews with 19 IHCA survivors were conducted to better understand their recovery experiences and identify strategies of adaptation that they felt aided their recovery. Thematic analysis indicated that IHCA survivors experience ongoing challenges to recovery. Reconceptualization of independence was necessary for some participants to re-engage in social and physical activities and a few were able to engage in new activities. Our findings suggest that IHCA survivors often develop their own strategies for adaptation in order to continue participation in their social lives and that their recovery experiences are ongoing. Intervention programs and follow-up care should continuously ask survivors what is important to them and identify resources that will support their goals. Questions should include physical, cognitive, psychological and social goals that extend beyond those specifically related to IHCA since our findings indicate that the effects of IHCA are long-lasting and encompass all aspects of survivors' lives.",

HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA.\nRESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5).\nDISCUSSION: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors is increasing. However, there remains limited knowledge on the long-term physical and psychological problems suffered by survivors and their relatives. The aims of the DANCAS (DANish cardiac arrest survivorship) survey are to describe the prevalence of physical and psychological problems, identify predictors associated with suffering them and to determine unmet rehabilitation needs in order to make recommendations on the timing and content of future rehabilitation interventions.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DANCAS survey has a cross-sectional design involving a survey of OHCA survivors and their relatives. OHCA survivors will be identified through the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry as having suffered an OHCA between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019. Each survivor will be asked to identify their closest relative to complete the relatives' survey. Contents of survivor survey: EQ-5D-5Level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Two Simple Questions, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, 12-item WHO Disability Assessment Scale 2.0, plus questions on unmet rehabilitation and information needs. Contents of relatives' survey: World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly-Cardiac Arrest and the Modified Caregiver Strain Index. Self-report outcome data collected through the surveys will be enriched by data from Danish national registries including demographic characteristics, circumstances of cardiac arrest and comorbidities. The survey will be completed either electronically or by post December 2020-February 2021.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Surveys and registry-based research studies do not normally require ethical approval in Denmark. This has been confirmed for this study by the Region of Southern Denmark ethics committee (20192000-19). Results of the study will be disseminated via several peer-reviewed publications and will be presented at national and international conferences.",

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following OHCA.\nMETHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to July 3, 2021, for studies reporting the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among OHCA survivors. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by two authors independently, and a third resolved discrepancies. A single-arm meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool the proportion of patients with these conditions at the earliest follow-up time point in each study and at predefined time points. Meta-regression was performed to identify significant moderators that contributed to between-study heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: The search yielded 15,366 articles. 13 articles were included for analysis, which comprised 186,160 patients. The pooled overall prevalence at the earliest time point of follow-up was 19.0% (11 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0-30.0%) for depression, 26.0% (nine studies; 95% CI = 16.0-39.0%) for anxiety, and 20.0% (three studies; 95% CI = 3.0-65.0%) for PTSD. Meta-regression showed that the age of patients and proportion of female sex were non-significant moderators.\nCONCLUSION: The burden of mental health disorders is high among survivors of OHCA. There is an urgent need to understand the predisposing risk factors and develop preventive strategies.",

We explored the psychological adjustment and experiential perspectives of survivors and families in the second year after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).\nMETHODS: A prospective, mixed-methods study of adult OHCA survivors in Victoria, Australia was conducted. Eighteen survivors and 12 family members completed semi-structured interviews 14-19 months post-arrest. Survivors' cognition, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured using a battery of psychological assessments. A thematic content analysis approach was applied to qualitative interview data by two independent investigators, with data coded and categorised into themes and sub-themes.\nRESULTS: Survivors' cognition, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms were not clinically elevated in the second year post-arrest. Subjective cognitive failures were associated with increased anxiety but not with mental state. Depression was significantly correlated with post-traumatic symptoms. Six primary themes emerged from survivors' recovery stories, focused on: awakening and realisation, barriers to adjustment, psychosocial difficulties, integration, protective factors and unmet needs. Family perspectives revealed four primary themes focused on trauma exposure, survivor adjustment problems, family impact, and areas for service improvement.\nCONCLUSION: Survivors and their family members describe complex recovery journeys characterised by a range of psychosocial adjustment challenges, which are not adequately captured by common psychological measures. Post-arrest care systems are perceived by survivors and their families as inadequate due to a lack of accurate information regarding post-arrest sequalae, limited follow-up and inconsistent access to allied health care.",

However, little is known about the joint OHCA-associated experiences among older survivors and their spouses in a long-term perspective. The aim of this study was to explore how narrative sense-making processes following OHCA shapes everyday life in a long-term perspective among older survivors and their spouses.\nMETHODS: Five older male survivors and their female spouses were interviewed individually using narrative methods. Arthur Frank's theory on illness narratives informed the analysis. Participant observation at two meetings for survivors and relatives regarding cardiac arrest was used for qualification of the interview guide.\nRESULTS: Five married couples participated. The mean age of the survivors and spouses was 70,4 and 71,4 years respectively, and time since OHCA varied from 12 to 66 months. Two themes of the dyadic experience emerged: 1) experiences during OHCA, and 2) experiences in life following OHCA. Subthemes differed with survivors emphasising a desire to return to the same life as before the OHCA, and the spouses narrating feelings of anxiety. Potential complications of the OHCA were often explained with reference to ageing processes, and the OHCA was contextualised in relation to previous life-changing events.\nCONCLUSION: In a long-term perspective, OHCA shapes the life trajectory of both the survivor and the spouse, and the relationship between them, underscoring a need for patient-centred care with a greater focus on the relationship of the dyads.",

Given that many post-CA patients are lost to follow-up (LTFU), we explored whether these patients are systematically different from those who complete follow-up based on demographic, resuscitation and outcome characteristics.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 168 English-speaking CA survivors between 9/25/2016 and 5/31/2018. We measured demographic data and global functional outcomes using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) in-person at hospital discharge, and via telephone at 3-, 6-months, and 1-year. We compared patients LTFU (e.g., failure to contact or refused to follow-up) with those contacted. Patients who were hospitalized, in a rehabilitation facility, missed by the research team, or dead were considered not eligible for follow-up.\nRESULTS: Of the 116 patients eligible for follow-up at 3-months, the majority completed follow-up (n = 69; 59.5%) and 47 (40.5%) were LTFU. Conversely, at 6-months and 1-year, fewer subjects were assessed (42% and 47%) compared to those who were LTFU (58% and 53%), respectively. At 3-months, LTFU patients were younger, unmarried, and had longer ICU stay. At 6-months and 1-year, LTFU patients were primarily male, had a non-shockable primary rhythm, and non-cardiac arrest etiologies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of patients are LTFU during the first year after CA, and differences emerged for demographics and characteristics of the event. Future research should account for the informative, non-random distribution of patients LTFU.",

Survivors completed the Questionnaire for the Quality of Provider-Patient Interactions (QQPPI), Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale (RHDS), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). When completing the QQPPI and RHDS, survivors were asked to think back to their hospitalization and discharge. QoL domains (physical, psychological, social) were measured via the WHO-QOL BREF. Three multiple regression models examined associations between QQPPI, RHDS, and B-IPQ scores with QoL domains, adjusted for age, sex, months since arrest, self-reported understanding of cardiac arrest and potential post-arrest symptoms at discharge, self-reported memory at discharge, and functional status as defined by the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.\nRESULTS: A total of 163 survivors (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean time since arrest: 63.9 months) provided complete survey data. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.45, p ​< ​0.001) and lower readiness for discharge (β: 0.21, p ​= ​0.01) were associated with worse physical QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.47, p ​< ​0.001) was associated with worse psychological QoL. More threatening illness perceptions (β: -0.28, p ​= ​0.001) and poor provider-patient communication (β: 0.35, p ​< ​0.001) were associated with worse social QoL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modifiable provider-patient relationship factors and illness perceptions were associated with quality of life in survivors of cardiac arrest with good neurologic recovery.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over 400,000 adults suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) each year in North America. Despite a very high mortality rate, even 10% survival means that a minimum of 3500 people return to their lives and their families. However, their experience of living and their health-related quality of life after such a life-changing event are quite variable, much more complex than just having lived or died, and should not be reduced to crude measures of neurological functioning.\nMETHODS: We conducted 32 in-depth qualitative interviews with survivor/family member dyads at various stages of survival. The interviews focused on the recovery journey, long-term issues most important to them and how measuring such concepts could help. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative thematic analysis techniques.\nRESULTS: During in-depth interviews with more than 30 survivors and caregivers we have heard that despite being a relatively high functioning group, their lives have been deeply affected by their cardiac arrest experience. They speak about the importance of both psychologic and physical recovery, the impact of return to work or changes in work identity and the necessity of support from family members in the recovery process. Spouses/family members also mentioned differences in perspective on their loved one's recovery and how they manage the fear of recurrence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work purposively brings a unique lens to the concept of cardiac arrest outcomes by placing priority on what is important to survivors and their families and what we may be missing in standard outcomes measures. There is a clear need for a more patient-centred outcome set for this population and our work indicates that psychologic assessment, return to work status and family input are key domains to be considered.",

Data from six audiotaped focus group interviews were collected in either November 2018 or in March 2019. Analysis and interpretation of the transcribed texts was performed using a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach guided by Ricoeur for unfolding lived experiences.\nRESULTS: Three narratives were identified. The survivors narrated how they in the early phase after the cardiac arrest experienced: (a) 'a fragmented memory at the mercy of the system'. The analysis further showed how the participants were: (b) 'living in the shadow of anxiety and mixed feelings' and with the: (c) 'lost sense of self' up to several years after survival.\nCONCLUSION: The participants in our study experienced distinct bodily impairments, suffering, and the lost sense of self in the return to daily life from early on to several years after resuscitation. There seem to be an urgent need for an early initiated post-arrest transitional care program led by an expert cardiac arrest nurse. In particular, the healthcare professionals need to pay attention to survivors in employment and with children living at home. Facilitated cardiac arrest peer support groups might minimize the long-term suffering, heighten the self-image, and install a new hope for the future.\nIMPACT: To ease the post-arrest return to daily life for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors it seems important that a transitional care program from the inhospital setting to the community consist of: (a) screening for and education on bodily losses at an early stage, (b) provision of support on the often prolonged emotional reactions, and (c) referring for further individual and targeted psychological and neurological follow-up and rehabilitation if needed.",
