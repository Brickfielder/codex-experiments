          This map updates automatically whenever a new paper is added to the Survivorship Repository.
          It uses the geographical location of the last author’s institutional affiliation as a proxy for the
          study’s country of origin. We acknowledge that this is a heuristic: many studies involve international
          teams, and last-author location does not fully capture the geographic diversity of all contributors.

          Nevertheless, this approach offers a helpful overview of where survivorship research after cardiac arrest is
          currently most represented — and highlights regions where further focus, collaboration, and investment may be
          needed.
