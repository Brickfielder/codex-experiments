  <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
    The OHCA Survivorship Repository curates peer-reviewed research on life after cardiac arrest,
    highlighting cognitive, psychological, quality-of-life, participation, and caregiver-focused
    studies. The project is stewarded by clinicians, researchers, and survivor advisors who review
    publications for relevance and rigor.

  <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
    This repository is updated manually approximately every two months, with additional ad-hoc
    updates if notable papers appear earlier. Each update includes validation against the shared
    schema, deduplication, automated tagging, and a changelog summarizing new contributions.
