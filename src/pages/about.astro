              Based at the Essex Cardiothoracic Centre and King's College Hospital (UK), Dr Marco
              Mion is a Clinical Psychologist and an Honorary Clinical Lecturer at Anglia Ruskin
              University. His research focuses on psychological, cognitive, and quality of life
              outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and the development of patient-centred
              care pathways. Dr Marco coordinated the UK neuropsychology arm of the TTM2 trial and
              currently leads a multi-site psychoeducational feasibility interventional study
              embedded within the STEPCARE trial (V-CARE).

              Dr Vicky Joshi is a Lecturer in Physiotherapy at Glasgow Caledonian University. Vicky
              is an internationally recognised researcher in cardiac arrest aftercare. She
              previously worked in Denmark researching the needs of survivors and families after
              cardiac arrest and currently leads the Save A Life for Scotland Recovery group
              (SALFS-R). She is the chief investigator on the Bystander aftercare research project
              investigating experiences of bystanders and is the co-ordinator for the SABRE
              interventional collaboration (Support After Bystander Resuscitation).

                A tailored search strategy—published in full for transparency and replicability—was
                applied to each database (PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science). Together, these
                searches returned a large pool of records spanning medical, nursing, psychological,
                and rehabilitation sciences. For each record, titles and abstracts were retrieved,
                except in cases where the abstract was unavailable in the source database.

                All records were merged into a single dataset. Using a custom Python-based
                deduplication script, duplicate entries were identified and removed through a
                combination of DOI matching, fuzzy title comparison, and metadata harmonisation. The
                deduplicated set represented the total pool of unique publications eligible for
                initial screening.

              <p>
                To support efficient human review, abstracts were processed using a
                sentence-transformer semantic model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). Each record received a
                semantic relevance score reflecting its conceptual proximity to the defined
                survivorship domain. Papers were then rank-ordered from most to least semantically
                aligned, but no automatic exclusions were made; this step was designed purely to
                structure workflow, not to determine eligibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, this semantic system tends to rank down studies focused exclusively on
                neuroprognostication, bystander interventions, survival-only registry analyses, or
                simulation/education studies, while prioritising work addressing cognitive,
                psychological, social, and quality-of-life outcomes.

                Two independent reviewers manually screened every abstract one by one, starting from

                cardiac arrest, covering cognitive, psychological, social, and quality-of-life

                Studies meeting inclusion criteria were added to the Survivorship Repository, with
