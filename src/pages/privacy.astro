          This website uses GoatCounter, a privacy-friendly analytics service, to understand 
          how the site is used and to help us improve content and navigation. 
          GoatCounter does not use tracking cookies, does not create advertising profiles, 
          and does not store IP addresses.
          With the current settings, GoatCounter records the following information when you visit a page:
        </p>
        <p>
          The page visited and time of visit
          A short-lived session identifier so multiple page loads in the same visit are counted as one “visit”, up to ~8 hours
          The website or campaign that referred you, if available
          Your browser and operating system from the User-Agent header, but the header itself is not stored
          Your screen size e.g. desktop vs mobile
          Your country and, for visitors from the US, Russia, or China, the region/state
          Your preferred language from the browser’s language settings
        </p>
        <p>This information is stored on GoatCounter’s servers as anonymised usage statistics. We cannot see your IP address or 
identify you as an individual, and we do not combine these analytics with any other data about you or use them for marketing.</p>
        <p>
          Usage data is currently retained for a year for aggregate reporting and long-term trend analysis. 
          If we change these settings in the future, this privacy notice will be updated.
